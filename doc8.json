The auto-tempering in the steel with coiling temperature of 260 \u00b0C\ncaused the softening of ferrite and martensite and the reduction in hardness difference between these\ntwo phases, ultimately led to the decrease in tensile strength and strain hardening ability and the in-\ncrease in post-necking elongation. The Charpy impact test results indicated that the toughness of auto-tempered steel was superior to the non-tempered steel. When the tensile test or impact test was con-ducted on the auto-tempered steel, both ferrite grains and tempered martensite islands were readily\nelongated as \ufb01brous structure. The acquired \ufb01brous structure could inhibit the formation of microvoids\nand propagation of cracks in tensile test, and delayed the tensile fracture. In addition, the \ufb01brous\nstructure could inhibit the propagation of main crack during impact test, whereas induced the branching\ncracks, leading to high impact energy.\n&2016 Elsevier B.V.

The \ufb01rst one is the addition of alloy elements, especially\nmicroalloying elements; the second one is the improvement of\nmanufacture processes to expose the potential properties of steels.\nThe latter is more attractive due to the advantages of productive\nresource usage and low-cost. Dual phase (DP) treatment is an\neconomical method to improve the mechanical properties ofsteels. The mechanical properties of DP steel, such as high tensile\nstrength, continuous yielding behavior, low yield strength and\nhigh strain hardening rate and so on, are closely associated with\nthe transformation and morphology of martensite [1\u20134]. Because\ntempering can change the morphology of martensite and other\nstructure characteristics derived from martensite transformation,\nsome of the mechanical properties of DP steel are sensitive to the\ntempering process.\nThe microstructure evolution and changes in strength and\nplasticity of heat treatment DP steel during tempering have been\nfully investigated through the isothermal tempering treatment [5\u2013\n9]. Chang [5]summarized that the microstructure exhibiteddifferent characteristics under the four isothermal tempering re-\ngimes: below 225 \u00b0C, 225 \u2013350 \u00b0C, 350 \u2013535 \u00b0C and above 535 \u00b0C,\nrespectively. Kuang [6]illustrated that the microstructure evolu-\ntion of DP steel during tempering included three stages: the relief\nof residual stress, the precipitation of carbides in both ferrite and\nmartensite, and the dissolution of carbides in the ferrite. At the\nhigher tempering temperature (above 300 \u00b0C), both tensile\nstrength and yield strength decreased, which was opposite to the\nelongation. When the tempering temperature lowered than\n200 \u00b0C, the changes in mechanical properties highly depended on\nthe tempering temperature and time. Except for tensile properties,\nfew studies focused on the effects of tempering on impact\ntoughness of DP steel. It is clear that the tempering of martensite\nreadily occurs in steels with lean chemical compositions, particu-\nlarly when the martensite forms near the martensite start tem-\nperature ( M\ns)[10,11]. Currently, the tempering of DP steels re-\nported in previous studies mainly stems from the reheating off-line, and few papers consider the tempering behavior occurred on\nhot rolling line. In fact, the tempering process after coiling can\noccur on the hot strip rolling line in the steels with thick gauge.\nBecause the residual heat is dif \ufb01cult to transfer into surroundings,\nthe tempering occurs in the steel coils, called \u201cauto-tempering \u201d.\nTherefore, it is expected that the auto-tempering would occur in\nthe hot rolled plain C-Mn DP steel with thick gauge when the steel\nare coiled at relative high temperature.Contents lists available at ScienceDirect\njournal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/mseaMaterials Science & Engineering A\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.msea.2016.04.038\n0921-5093/ &2016 Elsevier B.V.

The fracture behaviors during\ntensile test and impact test were discussed in details to provide\nfundamental understanding of the effects of auto-tempering on\nstrength, plasticity and toughness.\n2. Experimental procedure\n2.1. Thermo-mechanical controlled processing\nThe experimental steel was a plain C-Mn steel with a simple\nchemical composition of 0.06 C, 0.45 Si, and 1.55 Mn (wt%),\nwithout the addition of Ni, Cr and Mo (the measured amounts of\nNi, Cr and Mo were 0.009%, 0.02% and 0.005%, respectively). The\nexperiments were carried out on the CSP line of Baotou Steel in\nChina. The schematic diagram and the corresponding temperature\nregime are given in Fig. 1 . The steels were casted into casting slabs\nwith gauge of 70 mm and then held for 12 min at 1180 \u00b0Ci na\ntunnel furnace. The slabs were continuously hot-rolled into 11 mm\nthick strips with the \ufb01nish rolling temperature of 860 \u00b0C. After hot\nrolling, the strips were immediately cooled to 670 \u00b0C by laminar\ncooling system with the cooling rate of 30 \u00b0C/s, followed by air\ncooling, then fast cooled to 150 \u00b0C and 260 \u00b0C respectively through\nultra fast cooling system with the cooling rate of 120 \u00b0C/s, and\neventually coiled into coils. After coiling, the coils were cooled in\nthe air. The cooling rate of the coils in the air decreased with time,\npresented in Fig. 1 b. The air cooling process of coil from 260 \u00b0Ct o\n150 \u00b0C took about 4 h, while that from 150 \u00b0C to room temperature\ntook about 35 h. For convenience, the steels strips with coilingtemperatures of 150 \u00b0C and 260 \u00b0C were abbreviated as CT1 and\nCT2, respectively.\n2.2. Microstructure observation and mechanical properties test\nThe steel coils were cooled in the air for 48 h before being\nprepared into the specimens for metallography, tensile test and\nV-notch Charpy impact. The metallography specimens were me-\nchanically polished using standard metallographic procedure,\netched by 4% nital solution and observed using Leica-DMIRM op-\ntical microscope (OM) and ZEISS ULTRA 55 \ufb01eld emission scanning\nelectron microscopy (SEM), respectively. Additionally, the 3 mm\ndiscs were punched and twin-jet electro polished in a mixture of\n12.5% perchloric acid and 87.5% ethanol at /C030\u00b0C with a voltage\nof 32 V. They were observed in a FEI Tecnai G\n2F20\ufb01eld-emission\ntransmission electron microscope (TEM) operated at 200 kV.\nMicro-hardness measurements were carried out by FM-700\nVickers hardness testing machine with a load of 10 g. The tensile\nsamples with gauge length of 50 mm and diameter of 8 mm and\nthe V-notch Charpy impact specimens with the size of\n10 mm /C210 mm /C255 mm were prepared along the rolling direc-\ntion. CMT5105-SANS computerized tensile testing machine was\nused to detect the tensile properties with a crosshead speed of\n3 mm/min at room temperature. The Charpy impact test was im-\nplemented at /C020 to/C0100 \u00b0C using Instron Dynatup 9200 series\ninstrumented drop weight impact tester.\n3. Results\n3.1. Microstructural characteristics at different coiling temperatures\nFigs. 2 and, 3show the microstructures of the steels observedby OM, SEM and TEM. As shown in Figs. 2 a and 3a, the matrix of\nthe steels CT1 and CT2 consisted of /C2485% polygonal ferrite with\nthe average size of /C245.5mm. In the ferrite near the martensite/\nferrite interface, numerous dislocations were observed ( Figs. 2 b\nand 3b), which were induced by martensite transformation and\naffected the yielding behavior of dual phase steel [8]. The mar-\ntensite morphology exhibited much difference between steels CT1\nand CT2. Fig. 2 c and d shows that the surface of martensite islands\nwas smooth, suggesting no signi \ufb01cant martensite tempering oc-\ncurred at coiling temperature of 150 \u00b0C. However, presented in\nFig. 3 c and d, \ufb01ne carbide particles were clearly observed in the\nmartensite islands and the interface of ferrite and martensite ex-\nhibited less tetragonal, which inferred the martensite tempering at\ncoiling temperature of 260 \u00b0C. It is mentioned that there were also\nfew non-tempered martensites with small size in steel CT2\n(Fig. 3 e). The possible reason is that these small-sized martensites\nare highly enriched with carbon, forming at relative low tem-\nperature and dif \ufb01cult to be tempered.\nIt indicated that auto-tempering occurred in the plain C-Mn\ndual phase steel when the coiling temperature was 260 \u00b0C. In the\ndual phase steel, the Mswas calculated as follows [12]:\n= \u2212 \u2212 \u2212\u2212\u2212\n\u2212 ()MC M n N i C r S i\nMo539 423 30.4 17.7 12.1 11.0\n7.0 1s\nThe carbon content of untransformed austenite was estimated\nby:\n=( \u2212 ) ( \u2212 ) () \u03b3 \u03b1\u03b1 \u03b1ww f w f /1 2 0\nwhere w\u03b3,w0and w\u03b1were the carbon contents of untransformed\naustenite, prior austenite and ferrite, respectively, and f\u03b1is the\nvolume fraction of ferrite. In this work, the amounts of C, Si and\nMn were 0.06%, 0.45% and 1.55% respectively, and that of Ni, Cr and\nMo were ignored. The Msof untransformed austenite estimated\nfrom (Eqs. (1) and 2)was/C24320 \u00b0C. Therefore, the martensite\ntransformation accompanied with auto-tempering would occur at\nthe coiling temperature of 260 \u00b0C, which was far more close to the\nMsthan 150 \u00b0C. It was reported that the carbides formation during\ntempering was suppressed by increasing the contents of Mn and Si\n[13 \u201317]. However, the effect of Mn was weak when its content was\nless than 2% [15]. To suppress cementite formation, the Si content\nFig. 1.

Therefore, the 1.55% Mn and\n0.45% Si in the experimental steel may not play effectively role insuppressing carbide formation and increase the trends of auto-tempering.\nAuto-tempering led to the softening of both ferrite and mar-\ntensite. When the coiling temperature increased from 150 \u00b0Ct o\n260 \u00b0C, the micro-hardness of ferrite decreased from 148 HV to\n139 HV, and that of martensite dropped from 346 HV to 269 HV.\nThe softening degree of martensite was much larger than that offerrite, causing the reduction of hardness difference between thesetwo phases. This remarkable softening of martensite after auto-\ntempering is associated with the migration of carbon atoms, pre-\ncipitation of particles and recovery of dislocation structure and soon[18].\n3.2. Mechanical properties at different coiling temperatures\n3.2.1. Tensile properties\nIn the dual phase steel with low alloy, the auto-tempering is\nreadily occurred at the coiling temperature close to M\ns, as men-\ntioned above, which will alter the mechanical properties of the\nsteel. As shown in Fig. 4 , steel CT1 exhibited a continuous yielding\nthat was typical for dual phase steel. However, steel CT2 had ayield plateau with a pronounced increase in yield strength. It is\nknown that the continuous yielding of dual phase steel was mainly\nattributed to the mobile dislocations produced by martensitetransformation at low temperature [1,7,19,20], for example in\nFig. 3 a. Dislocations, one of structure defects in crystalline solid\nsolutions, are disturbed regions with low thermodynamically\nstability, and attract solute segregation when diffusion is enable[21 \u201323]. Therefore, when the coiling temperature increased to\n260 \u00b0C, C and N atoms was considered to diffuse to the dislocations\nand pinned them. Many researches had also demonstrated thatthe interstitial atoms of C and N could segregate and pin the dis-locations when the tempering temperature increased to /C24250 \u00b0C,\nleading to the rise in yield strength and the appearance of yield\nplatform [7\u20139,19,23]. In this study, the yield plateau and the sig-\nni\ufb01cantly increase in yield strength, to some extent, revealed that\ninterstitial atoms of C and N segregated and pinned the disloca-\ntions during auto-tempering.\nAs listed in Table, 1 , steel CT1 was characterized by high tensile\nstrength and strong strain hardening ability, which attributed to\nthe high hardness of quenched martensite [24 \u201326]. For steel CT2,\nthe tensile strength decreased distinctly due to the softening ofmartensite. The reduction of hardness difference between ferriteand martensite caused by auto-tempering resulted in the decrease\nof strain hardening ability [24,25]. When the coiling temperature\nincreased from 150 \u00b0C to 260 \u00b0C, the uniform elongation decreased\nfrom 16.5% to 13%, which demonstrated that the auto-tempering\nstimulated the occurrence of necking. It is known that the necking\nappears when the strain hardening rate ( ds/d\n\u03b5) is equal or less\nthan the true stress ( s)[27], and the corresponding strain is the\nuniform strain ( \u03b5u), shown in Fig. 5 . Thus, the increase of strain\nhardening rate or the decrease of true stress can postpone the\noccurrence of necking. After auto-tempering, both the strain\nhardening rate and the true stress reduced, but the degree of the\nformer was more prominent. Therefore, the auto-tempering ac-\ncelerated the occurrence of necking. Nevertheless, the stress-strain\ncurve of steel CT2 had a distinct necking stage ( Fig. 4 ), and the\npost-necking elongation and reduction of area reached 23.5% and\n86%, respectively, higher than that of steel CT1. The data indicates\nthat steel CT2 has the high fracture resistance.\n3.2.2. Charpy impact energy and fractograph of the specimens\nFig. 6 indicates that the toughness of steel CT2 was higher than\nthat of steel CT1. The impact energy ( vE) of steel CT1 was sensitive\nto the test temperature and decreased from /C24185 J to /C2410 J with\nthe temperature decreasing from /C020\u00b0Ct o/C0100 \u00b0C. However,\nthe toughness of steel CT2 under the test temperature range of\n/C020 to /C060 \u00b0C was such excellent (higher than 300 J) that the\nspecimens cannot be completely separated. When the tempera-\nture decreased from /C060 \u00b0Ct o/C0100 \u00b0C, the value of vEsharply\ndropped to /C2415 J from /C24320 J.\nThe impact specimen macrofractographs of steel CT1 are given\ninFig. 7 .A t/C020\u00b0C and /C040\u00b0C, the macrofractographs of steel\nCT1 contained the typical \ufb01brous, radial, second \ufb01brous and shear\nlip zones, marked by 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively in Fig. 7 a. The \ufb01-\nbrous, second \ufb01brous and shear lip zones of the steel CT1 at\n/C020\u00b0C consisted of dimples ( Fig. 7 d\u2013f), re \ufb02ecting the ductile\nfracture. The dimples in \ufb01brous and second \ufb01brous zones were\nstretched due to the shear stress.

At /C060\u00b0C, the radial\nzone occupied almost all the fracture surface of specimens.\nFor steel CT2, shown in Fig. 8 a, d and e, the fracture surfaces of\nunseparated specimen tested at /C060\u00b0C consisted of dimples, and\nthe branching cracks were observed in the fracture surface. The\nmacrofractures of steel CT2 at /C080\u00b0C(Fig. 8 b) were familiar to\nthat of steel CT1 at /C020\u00b0C and /C040\u00b0C. However, Fig. 8 f\u2013h shows\nthat the dimples of steel CT2 were larger than that of steel CT1,\nindicating the superior toughness. At /C0100 \u00b0C, the fracture surface\nof specimens were mainly comprised of radial zone, which proven\nthe low toughness at this temperature.\nAssuming that the test temperature corresponding to where\nthe area of radial zone occupies 50% of the fracture surface is the\nductile-to-brittle transition temperature (DBTT), the DBTT reduced\nto/C2480\u00b0C from /C2440\u00b0C when the steel was auto-tempered. The\ntransition of ductile-to-brittle attributed to the competition of\nplastic deformation and brittle fracture at the tips of cracks or\ndefects, and the DBTT was determined by the difference between\ntensile stress near the crack tips and the brittle fracture stress [28 \u2013\n30]. According to Yoffee diagram [28,29], when the effective yield\nstress, at which signi \ufb01cant deformation occurs, exceeds the brittle\nfracture stress, the brittle fracture occurs. Although the yieldstrength of steel CT2 was higher than that of steel CT1 during\ntensile test, the stress of steel CT2 was lower than steel CT1 when\nthe strain exceeds 0.01, shown in Fig. 4 , which resulted from the\nsoftening of ferrite and martensite. In addition, the softening of\nsteel CT2 caused by auto-tempering led to the extensive plastic\ndeformation before fracture. It was clear that the extensive plastic\ndeformation at the crack tip limited the local stress and inhibited\nthe brittle fracture [31]. Therefore, the auto-tempering played an\neffective role in delaying the transition of ductile-to-brittle.\n4. Discussion\n4.1. Effects of auto-tempering on tensile fracture behavior\nFig. 9 indicates that both the two steels fractured under ductile\nmechanism with cup-and-cone fracture. The steels suffered an\nobvious plastic deformation before fracture. However, the degree\nof section contraction of steel CT2 was much larger than that of\nsteel CT1, indicating that auto-tempering provided superior duc-\ntility for DP steel. The fracture surfaces included two parts: central\ufb01ber zone and surrounding shear lip, marked in Fig. 9 . During the\ntensile test, the microvoids virtually begin to initiate before\nFig. 6.

The coa-\nlescence of microvoids leads to the microcracks, which grow per-\npendicular to the applied stress and evolve into the central \ufb01ber\nzone. As the necking further continues, the crack propagates along\nthe 45 \u00b0maximum shear stress direction and develops into the\nshear lip [28,32]. The shear lip of steel CT2 exhibited ring-like with\n\u201c\u039b\u201dshape, which was caused by the severe deformation before\nfracture. As shown in the micrographs at high magni \ufb01cation, the\nfracture surfaces of the steels were composed of dimples. Never-\ntheless, the dimples in the \ufb01ber zone of steel CT2 were much\nlarger and deeper than that of steel CT1, which may be the reason\nthe post-necking elongation of steel CT2 was much larger than\nthat of steel CT1.\nFig. 10 shows the micrographs at subsurface under the main\nfracture surface of tensile specimens. The ferrite grains and mar-\ntensite islands were elongated in the necking zone of steel CT1, but\nthe elongated extent of ferrite grains was much higher than that of\nmartensite islands due to the large hardness difference between\nferrite and non-tempered martensite. The deformation in-\ncompatibility between ferrite and martensite resulted in high\nstress concentration, especially where the shape of martensite was\ntetragonal and sharp. Since the deformation between ferrite and\nmartensite was highly incompatible ( Fig. 10 a) and the pure mar-\ntensites were tetragonal ( Fig. 2 c) in steel CT1, lots of microvoids\ninitiated around the tips of the elongated martensite islands (in-\ndicated by arrows in Fig. 10 a), which led to the relatively small\npost-necking elongation.\nFor steel CT2, both ferrite grains and tempered martensite is-\nlands were severely elongated as \ufb01brous structure. The larger\ndeformation and the better deformation compatibility between\nferrite and tempered martensite were due to the softening and\nreduction of hardness difference between these two phases.Fig. 10 b indicates that the microvoids in steel CT2 tended to in-\nitiate near the non-tempered martensite islands and inclusions\nbecause the deformations of ferrite matrix and non-tempered\nmartensite (or inclusion) were still incompatibility. Since most of\nmartensite islands were auto-tempered and became less tetra-\ngonal ( Fig. 3 c) and the ferrite and martensite compatibly deformed\nas\ufb01brous structure, the stress concentration was small compared\nto steel CT1. Therefore, the nucleation sites of microvoids in steel\nCT2 (indicated by arrows in Fig. 10 b) was far less than that in steel\nCT1. The fewer nucleation sites of microvoids could explain why\nthe dimples in fracture surface of steel CT2 were much larger and\ndeeper than steel CT1. Additionally, the cracks in steel CT2 were\nexpected to propagate more dif \ufb01cult to across the section of ten-\nsile specimen due to the \ufb01brous structure normal to the propa-\ngation direction of cracks. Although both of two steels fractured\nwith ductile mechanism, steel CT2 exhibited the higher ability to\nprevent the crack formation and propagation.\n4.2. Effects of auto-tempering on impact fracture behavior\nTo investigate the fracture process and the fracture behavior of\nthe steels at different temperatures, the impact load ( P), impact\nenergy and de \ufb02ection ( u) were recorded by instrument during\nimpact test. Fig. 11 a and b show that the P-ucurves of steel CT1 at\n/C020\u00b0C and /C040\u00b0C had the similar shape. At the beginning, the\nimpact load increased rapidly to the peak value Pm. In this stage,\nthe elastic deformation and plastic deformation occurred succes-\nsively, and the absorbed energy corresponding to the Pmwas crack\ninitiate energy ( vEi). The value of vEiat/C020\u00b0C and /C040\u00b0C were\nstable at 40 \u201345 J in steel CT1. Then, with the increase in u, the\nvalue of Pslowly decreased to Py, then dropped to Paand slowly\nreduced to zero ( P0), successively. The stages of PmPy,PyPaand PaP0\nre\ufb02ected the processes of ductile propagation, brittle fracture and\nFig. 10.

This suggested that\nthe lower temperature accelerated the crack propagation and\neventually deteriorates the toughness.\nThe microvoids and cracks underneath the fracture surface of\nspecimen at /C020\u00b0C for steel CT1 are presented in Fig. 12 a and b.\nMicrovoids were observed underneath the \ufb01brous zone of fracture\nsurface, implying the ductile fracture.

In\ntheP-ucurves at /C060 to /C0100 \u00b0C, the ductile propagation and\nductile fracture stages disappeared ( Fig. 11 c\u2013e), which suggests\nthat the fracture mechanism converted from mixture of ductileand brittle fracture to complete brittle fracture.\nInFig. 11 a\u2013c, the P-ucurves of steel CT2 at /C020 to /C060\u00b0C\nexhibited a distinct ductile propagation stage. It indicated that the\nauto-tempering played an effective role in suppressing the pro-\npagation of cracks. With increase in u,Pdecreased slowly from P\nm,\nthen rapidly declined to the \ufb01rst plateau stage, and the second\nplateau stage, and \ufb01nally dropped to zero when the specimen was\nstruck away from the specimen holder. This similar plateau-step of\nP-ucurve was also observed in the low-carbon steel with severe\nelongated structure, multilayer composite steel and glass- \ufb01ber/\nvinyl-ester composite [29,33,34]. In these materials, the branching\ncracks tended to propagate along the interfaces of elongated\nstructure or \ufb01ber planes that were normal to the propagation di-\nrection of the main crack. In this case, the propagation of the main\ncracks was restrained, resulting in the plateau stage of P-ucurve.\nThe impact load dropped when the new cracks initiated.

    "page_9": "fracture surface ( Fig. 12 b and c) of the impact specimens, the\nbranching cracks were observed clearly in steel CT2 at /C020\u00b0C and\n/C060\u00b0C. The branching cracks were attributed to the acquired \ufb01-\nbrous structure. Presented in Fig. 12 b and c, the branching cracks\npropagated along the interface of \ufb01brous structure.\nThe shape of P-ucurve of steel CT2 at /C080\u00b0C(Fig. 11 d) was\nsimilar to that of steel CT1 at /C020 to/C040\u00b0C, showing the similar\nfracture mechanism. In Fig. 12 e and f, similar to micrographs of\nsteel CT1 at /C020\u00b0C(Fig. 12 a and b), the microvoids and the\ntransgranular cracks were observed in \ufb01brous and radial zones,\nrespectively. At /C0100 \u00b0C, the P-ucurve of steel CT2 exhibited the\nbrittle type. Consequently, with the decrease in test temperature\nfrom/C020\u00b0Ct o/C0100 \u00b0C, the fracture mechanism of steel CT2\ntransferred from ductile fracture accompanied with branching\ncrack to mixture of ductile and brittle fracture, and \ufb01nally to brittle\nfracture.\n5. Conclusions\n1. The microstructure consisted of polygonal ferrite and non-tempered martensite islands in the hot rolled plain C-Mn DP\nsteel coiled at 150 \u00b0C. When the coiling temperature was 260 \u00b0C,\nthe interface of ferrite and martensite became less tetragonal,\nand the \ufb01ne carbide particles dispersed in the martensite is-\nlands were also observed. Both of them re \ufb02ected the occurrence\nof auto-tempering, leading to the softening of ferrite and mar-\ntensite and the reduction of hardness difference between these\ntwo phases.\n2. The auto-tempering resulted in the appearance of yield plat-\nform with the increase in yield strength, while both the strain\nhardening rate and the tensile strength decreased. In particular,\nthe auto-tempered DP steel exhibited a distinct necking stage,\nimplying the superior ductility. During tensile test, the ferrite\ngrains and tempered martensite islands were severely elon-\ngated as \ufb01brous structure, which effectively postponed the\ntensile fracture.\n3. Compared with the non-tempered steel, the auto-tempered DP\nsteel had higher impact energy and lower DBTT. When the test\ntemperature decreased from /C020 to /C060\u00b0C, the fracture me-\nchanism of non-tempering DP steel converted from mixture of\nductile and brittle fracture to complete brittle fracture. At the\ntest temperature above /C060\u00b0C, the impact specimens of auto-\nFig. 12.
