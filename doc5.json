For instance, AISI 52100 is a highcarbon alloy steel which achieves a high degree of hardness\nwith compressive strength and abrasion resistance used in\nballandrollerbearings,spinningtools,punches,anddies.Insuchcases,toachievetherequiredpropertiesheattreatmentmethodsarecommonlyused.\nMartempering is a common heat treatment process that\nquenches the material to an intermediate temperature justabove the martensite start temperature (\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\n\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60)\nand then cools\nair through the martensitic transformation range to roomtemperature[1\u20134].Itisimportanttoair-coolthroughoutthetransformation range since rapid cooling through this rangeisrequiredtoproduceresidualstresspatternssimilartothose\nproduced by a direct quench and negate any advantages of\nthe process [5]. Modi\ufffded martempering (MM) is a similartechnique wherein the intermediate quench temperature isbelow\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\n\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60b\nutabovethemartensite\ufffdnishtemperature(\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc53)[3,4].\nTemperingofmartemperedormodi\ufffdedmartempered\nsteels to the desired hardness and tensile strength is per-formed identically to that in quench and temper operations\nwithbetterimpactresistance.Commonlymartemperedsteels\nincludeAISI1090,4140,4340,6050,andSAE52100[3].\nAustemperingisamethodofhardeningsteelbyquench-\ningfromtheaustenitizingtemperatureintoaheatextracting\nmedium (usually molten salt) which is maintained at speci-\n\ufffdedtemperaturelevelbetween200\u2218C\nand400\u2218C\nandholding\nthe steel in this medium until austenite is transformed tobainite.\ue062ismethodisusedtoincreasestrength,toughness,\nand to reduce distortion. \ue062e two processes are heating\na medium-to-high carbon ferrous metal to an austeniticconditionthencoolingtheobjectrapidlyenoughtoavoidtheformationofpearlitetoatemperatureabove \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\n\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60t\nemperature\nand isothermally holding the part for a time su\ufb03cient toproducethedesiredmicrostructure.Butthesetwoprocessesaregenerallylimitedtosmallcomponents.\nDue to their high applicability, these processes are\nexplored by many researchers. \ue062e amount of retainedaustenite in Cr-Mo steels used in mill liner was studied byShaerietal.[6].\ue062ee\ufb00ectsofheattreatmentsincludingdirectHindawi Publishing Corporation\nISRN Tribology\nVolume 2013, Article ID 515484, 6 pages\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5402/2013/515484\nPublication Year 2013",

Wear resistance of the material wasreducedasaresultofthepresenceofphasewithlowhardness\nand strength. Unfavorable dimensional variations appear in\nthespecimensresultingfromthetransformationofausteniteto martensite during tempering or upon severe impacts\napplied to the liners during milling process. Transformation\nof austenite to martensite during tempering gives rise toa volume change in austenite resulting in the formationof a severe compressive stress at the austenite-martensite\nboundary.

Data regarding improved impact energy are sparse\nand appear to be most widely reported for the high-carbonsteels. \ue062e results of impact energy and tensile strength thatare compared between quenched and tempered to that of\nmodi\ufffded martempered had no much di\ufb00erence, and the\nanalystmustcheckforthemartemperingprocess.\nWear resistance properties of Austempered Ductile Iron\n(ADI)werestudiedbyLernerandKingsbury[9].Adetailed\nreview of wear resistance properties of ADI was undertaken\nto examine the potential applications of this material forwear parts, as an alternative to steels, alloyed and white\nirons, bronzes, and other competitive materials. Two modes\nof wear were studied: adhesive (frictional) dry sliding andabrasivewear.Intherotatingdryslidingtests,wearbehaviorof the base material (a stationary block) was considered in\nrelationship to counter surface (steel sha\ue09d) wear.

Only quenched DI with afully martensitic matrix slightly out performed ADI. No\nsigni\ufffdcantdi\ufb00erencewasobservedinthewearofsteelsha\ue09ds\nrunning against ADI and quenched DI. \ue062e excellent wearperformance of ADI and its counter surface, combined withtheir relatively low-friction coe\ufb03cient, indicate potential for\ndryslidingwearapplications.Intheabrasivewearmode,the\nwearrateofADIwascomparabletothatofalloyedhardenedAISI4340steel,andapproximatelyone-halfthatofhardenedmedium carbon AISI 1050 steel and of white and alloyed\ncast irons. \ue062e wear resistance of ADI may be attributed to\nthe strain-a\ufb00ected transformation of high-carbon austeniteto martensite that takes place in the surface layer during theweartests.\nJetley [10] reported improvement in wear properties of\naircra\ue09d brake steel rotors by martempering. Martemperingprocess using oil- and water-based quenchants at lowertemperature is adopted in this work. \ue062e test samples were\nevaluated for hardness, distortion, and wear under acceler-\nated simulated tests. \ue062e results show that although bothhardness and wear resistances were lower compared to the\naustempering,theymetthedesignintent.Alsothewearrate\nof martempered samples was more consistent which mayprovideadvantagesformaintenancepurposes.\nWear of hard-turned AISI 52100 steel was studied by\nBartha et al. [11]. High precision machining such as hardturning changes the surface and the material properties ofsteelalloys.Aslidingblock-on-cylinderweartesterwasusedfor the purpose of testing the wear performance of AISI\n52100-bearingsteel.\ue062ee\ufb00ectofmicrostructureonthewear\nperformanceofhard-turnedsteelshowedthatthewhitelayerand overtempered martensite (OTM) had a higher wearresistancethanmartensite.\ue062ewearmechanismdependence\non the surface hardness was attributed to this increase in\nwear performance. \ue062e near-surface residual stress of thematerial was shown to become more compressive as thematerial wore down. \ue062e applied normal loads a\ufb00ected the\nsurface roughness, residual stresses, and, in turn, the wear\nperformanceofthematerial.\n2.Experimentation\n\ue062e chemical composition of the investigated steel is deter-\nminedbyopticalemissionspectrometerandshowninTable\n1. \ue062e dimensions of the as-cast specimens were 75mm \u00d7\n25mm\u00d712mm for abrasive wear test, 75mm \u00d710mm\u00d7\n8mm for impact test, and 6mm diameter pins of 30mm\nlength for pin on disc test, respectively.
