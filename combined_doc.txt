Abstract
Theroleofheattreatmentontheerosionandcorrosionbehaviorof52100steelwasinvestigatedintermsof:(i)electrochemicalparameter

Basedonboththepolarizationresistanceandcorrosionratemeasurements,itwasfoundthatatemperingtreatmentgivesrisetotheslowest
corrosion kinetics. For both the annealed and tempered specimens, where the microstrain is created solely from mechanical deformationduring erosion, there is a reasonable agreement between the calculated corrosion rate based on a mechano-electrochemical effect and theexperimentally measured corrosion rate. However, for the quenched specimens in which a high level of microstrain is generated on quench-ing, there is a signiﬁcant difference between the calculated (from mechano-electrochemical effect) and experimentally measured corrosionrates.© 2004 Elsevier B.V.

by slurry abrasion [14,15].
High stress collisions between the grinding media and
the ore charge in the mill lead to direct mechanicalloss of metal from the ball surfaces, resulting in abra-sive wear. Impact wear, resulting from large fall heights,is determined by surface hardness, spalling tendency andresistance to breakage under the impact of the grindingmedia.
The hardness of the grinding media is a determining pa-

corrosion, the hardness and the corrosion resistance are twocontrollingparametersandshouldbeinvestigatedinordertoreduce material losses.

2. Experimental details
2.1. Materials and heat treatment
ThematerialusedinthisinvestigationwasanAISI52100
bearing steel. This was chosen to represent the high carbon,low alloy steels being used in the commercial grinding in-dustries.Thechemicalcomposition(wt.%)was1.05C,1.70Cr, 0.34 Mn, 0.06 Mo, 0.18 Ni, 0.26 Si, 0.12 Cu, 0.016 S,balance Fe.
All the specimens for erosion, corrosion and electro-
chemical testing were in the form of plates with dimen-sions: 50mm length, 25mm width and 2mm thickness.The specimens were polished using SiC abrasive papers,#180 to #600 grit, before they were subjected to heat treat-ment, erosion–corrosion testing and electrochemical mea-surements.
The heat treatments included annealing, quenching and
tempering. The annealing was carried out by holding for 1hat 750
◦C, and then furnace cooling to room temperature.
The quenching treatment was performed by holding for onehourat900
◦C,thenquenchingtheheatedsamplesintowater.
Tempering was carried out on the quenched specimens for10h at 650
◦C[17].
After the heat treated specimens were removed from the
furnace or quenching media, the outer layer of loose oxidewas mechanically removed using a plastic plate. The spec-imens were then immersed in a hydrochloric acid solutioncontaining 50% HCl (36%) and 50% water [18], and stirred
usingaglassrodtoelectrochemicallydissolvetheinnerlayerofoxide.Thespecimenswerethoroughlyrinsedusingtapwa-terinordertoremoveanyacidresidueonthesurface,andthencompletely dried to avoid further corrosion. The specimenswith a clean and active surface were then ready for the ero-sion, corrosion and electrochemical measurements/testing.
2.2. Erosion testing
Dry erosion was conducted in a custom-made erosion
tester with SiC particles as the erodent. The SiC particleswere accelerated with pressurized air in a long horizontaltube. The erosion angle was set at 45
◦and the total erosion
weights were 10, 50 and 100g of SiC particles [16].
2.3. Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical measurements were conducted in a
tri-electrode cell with a saturated calomel electrode (SCE)as the reference electrode (RE) and a graphite plate asthe counter electrode (CE). Electrochemical measurementswere carried out in 2g/l NaCl and 2g/l Na
2SO4solu-
tions to simulate the chemical composition of practical oregrinding process solutions (adjusted to neutral pH) on both
eroded and uneroded specimens using a Solartron 1285
potentiostat.
The measured electrochemical parameters included the
open-circuit potential, polarization resistance ( Rp), corro-
sion potential, Tafel slopes ( βaandβc), corrosion rate, lin-
ear polarization curves and Tafel potentiodynamic polariza-tioncurves.Basedontheelectrochemicalparametersandthestrainenergy,asynergisticeffectbetweenerosionandcorro-sion was evaluated.
2.4. Measurements of the microstrain induced by
erosion of heat-treated 52100 steel
XRD analysis was used to characterize the microstrain
induced by the impact of SiC particles. The correspondingstored strain energy can be calculated from this microstrainand the synergistic effect correlating strain energy and elec-trochemical potential can be characterized. A Phillips X-raydiffractometerwithaproportionalcounterdetectionheadwasused.GraphitemonochromatedCuk /H9251radiation,atavoltage
of40kVandacurrentof20mA,wasutilizedasthediffract-ing medium.
The AISI 52100 steel was ﬁrst fully annealed in order
to determine the instrumental broadening (all the broaden-ing of the diffraction peaks for an fully annealed specimenis assumed to be only from instrumental effects). The scan-ning angles (2 θ) were from 30 to 150
◦at a scanning step
of 0.5◦. A XRD pattern of intensity versus 2 θwas obtained.
There were six peaks recorded for each heat-treated spec-imen and the peak positions were determined. Then, theheat-treated and eroded specimens were scanned again ata scanning rate of 0.02
◦in a small angular range around
the six peaks to determine the broadening of the XRDpeaks.
From the broadening of the XRD peaks, the microstrain
due to erosion can be calculated [18,19]. The broadening is
determined by measuring the width B, in radians, at an in-
tensity equal to half the maximum intensity. If the observedX-raypeakoferodedspecimenhasawidth B

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Effect of heat treatment on the electrochemical
characteristics
The 52100 steel exhibited different electrochemical be-
haviorwithdifferentheat-treatments. Fig.1ashowstheopen-
circuitpotentialsasafunctionoftimefortheun-erodedspeci-menswithdifferentheattreatments.Theannealedsamplehasthelowest(negative)open-circuitpotentialandthequenchedsample has the highest open-circuit potential. The temperedsample lies in the middle. Fig. 1b–d, respectively, show theopen-circuit potentials of the heat-treated steels eroded with
10, 50 or 100g SiC particles at an erosion angle of 45
◦.
The eroded samples show a similar trend for all three heattreatments, in that the potentials are arranged in the order ofquenched,temperedandannealedsamplesfromamorepos-itive to a more negative potential. Thermodynamically, theannealed specimens are always the most prone to corrosionandthequenchedspecimensaretheleastpronetocorrosion.
Besides the thermodynamically-affected electrochemical
parameters, heat-treatment also affects the kinetics of thecorrosion reaction of eroded specimens. Linear polarizationmeasurements ( ±10mV) were conducted on heat-treatedJ. Xie et al. / Materials Science and Engineering A 393 (2005) 42–50 45

To illustrate the effect of heat-treatment, the polarization
resistances obtained from the linear polarization curves areplotted in a bar graph form in Fig. 2. The annealed samples
have the lowest value of polarization resistance, indicatingthe possible highest corrosion rate. Generally speaking, thetempered samples have the highest polarization resistance(exceptfortheunerodedsamples,whichhasaslightlylowervalue than the quenched sample), indicating the lowest cor-rosion rate for the tempered specimen. Thus it is concludedthatatemperingheattreatmentismuchbetterthanastraightquenching treatment and is recommended from the view-point of corrosion, even though the quenched sample has averyhighhardness( Table1),whichisindicativeofimproved
wearresistance.Inthegrindingindustry,wherewetgrindingisthemostcommonlyusedmethod,bothcorrosionandwearresistance should be considered in material selection.
To further understand the effect of heat-treatment on
the electrochemical behavior of eroded 52100 steel, thepolarization behavior was investigated using a potentiody-

onthepotentiodynamicpolarizationcurvesfortheun-eroded,and the eroded samples with 10, 50 and 100g SiC particles,respectively. Heat-treatment changes both the shape and theposition of the curves, indicating that both the corrosion po-tentialandthecorrosionreactionkinetics(Tafelslopes β
aand
βc) have changed. Fig. 4shows the effect of heat treatment
onthecorrosionpotential.Generallyspeaking,theannealedsample has the lowest negative potential, reﬂecting a highelectrochemical activity. At a lower erosion level (10g), thetemperedsamplehasamorenegativecorrosionpotentialthanthe quenched sample, but at higher levels of erosion (50g),the tempered sample has a higher potential. In practical, i.e.commercial, grinding, the grinding media are subjected torepeated erosion and collision, and the amount of particlesis signiﬁcantly larger than 100g. According to the trend incorrosion potential as shown in Fig. 4, the tempered sample
will have the highest corrosion potential on further erosion,indicating that it is the least prone to corrosion. Thus it isfurtherconﬁrmedthat,asaresultofahighhardnessandlowelectrochemicalactivity,temperingistheoptimumheattreat-mentforreducingmateriallossesinthegrindingballsduetothe synergistic effect of erosion and corrosion.
Since heat-treatment has an effect on the polarization
resistance and the potentiodynamic characteristics, it mustalso affect the corrosion rates. Fig. 5shows the corrosion
ratesoftheheat-treatedsamplesasafunctionoftheamountof erodent. Both the annealed and the quenched specimenshave higher corrosion rates, and the corrosion rates increaserapidlywithincreasingamountoferodent.However,thetem-peredspecimenhasthelowestcorrosionrate,andthecorro-sion rate increases more slowly with increasing amount oferodentthaneithertheannealedorthequenchedspecimens.There is also a suggestion that the corrosion rate reaches aplateau at higher levels of erosion for the tempered speci-mens.
3.2. The effect of heat treatment on strain energy
The quenching treatment itself introduces signiﬁcant mi-
crostrain into the steel which is not present in the annealedand tempered specimens ( Fig. 6). The tempering heat treat-
ment relieves the residual stress from the quenching treat-ment,whichcausesthehighcorrosionrate(shownin Fig.5).
The tempered samples have an adequate level of hardness(Table 1), such that erosion doesn’t generate signiﬁcant mi-
crostrains in the tempered sample. However, the annealedsample,whichisrelativelyquitesoft,iseasilydeformedandhighermicrostrainsareintroducedthaninthetemperedsam-ples.
Theincreasedstrainenergyduetothemicrostraincanbe
calculated from the following equation [22,23]:

lated stored strain energies for the heat-treated specimensare shown in Fig. 7. Quenching introduces a signiﬁcant
amount of strain energy due to the high level of micros-train, while annealing and tempering remove the micros-train and the corresponding strain energy is dramaticallyreduced.3.3. Synergistic effect between erosion and corrosion for
heat-treated 52100 steel
According to a theoretical analysis of the mechano-

that the corrosion rate of a deformed electrode is larger thanthat of the undeformed electrode and that the increased an-odic corrosion rate depends on two factors, namely: (i) thestored strain energy ( A) and (ii) the decreased corrosion po-

4. Conclusions
An investigation of the electrochemical behavior and mi-
crostrain and strain energy for 52100 steel specimens withdifferent heat treatments subjected to erosion–corrosion ledto the following conclusions:
1. Heat treatment causes changes in the open-circuit poten-
tial,corrosionpotential,polarizationresistance,polariza-tion behavior, corrosion rate, and microstrain and storedstrain energies.
2. Both the annealed and tempered specimens show a syn-
ergistic effect, which can be modeled using a mechano-electrochemical model, i.e. the theoretically calculatedand experimentally measured corrosion rates agree wellwith each other.
3. The erosion–corrosion behavior of quenched specimens,
which contain high levels of microstrain from quench-ing,cannotbemodeledbythemechano-electrochemicalmodel.
4. Atemperedsteeliskineticallytheleastsusceptibletocor-
rosion.Temperedsteelhaslowestpolarizationresistance,whichisinverselyproportionaltocorrosionrate,andlow-est stored strain energy, indicating the lowest thermody-namic and electrochemical activities.

Abstract  
 
AISI 52100 bearing steels  are commonly used in applicat ions requiring high hardness and abrasion resistance. The bearing steels are 
working under dynamic loads in service conditions and their toughness properties become important. In order to provide the de sired 
mechanical properties, various heat treatments ( austenizing , quenching  and tempering) are usually applied. In this study, AISI 52100 
bearing steel samples were austenized  at 900°C for ½ h and water quenched to room temperature. Then tempering  was carried out at 
795°C, 400°C  and 200°C for ½ h. In order t o investigate the effect of heat treatment conditions on wear behavior , dry friction tests were 
performed according to ASTM G99 -05 Standard  with a ‘ball -on-disk’ type tribometer. The samples were tested against steel and ceramic 
counterparts using the para meters of 100 m distance and 30 N load and 0.063 m/s  rotational speed. After wear test,  the surface  
characterization was carried out using microscopy. Wear loss values were calculated using a novel optical method on both flat and 
counterpart specimens.

1. Introduction  
 
Today, the bearing steels are used as one of the key 
components in design and manufacturing of various machinery 
parts. They must , therefore,  ensur e a series of requirements 
including wear and fatigue resistance under rolling/sliding 
contacts, axial loadings and crack propagation and growth, as well 
as high or adequate hardness, strength, toughness, ductility and 
last but not least , corrosion resista nce [1-5].  
Alloy compositions including carbon amount between 0.8 -1.1 
wt-% and substitutional solute elements amount up to 3.0 wt -% 
are commonly chosen for bearing applications. The matrices of 
these groups of steel alloys are preferably transformed to martensite after quenching in suitable media , e.g. oil or salt. Due 
to the relatively high alloy elements and carbon content, 
martensitic matrices need to be tempered to suppress the excess 
brittleness. Hardenability depth is another important key factor, 
particularly for those steel parts, which possess relatively large 
cross -sectional area. When this depth value is not sufficient at 
given dimensions of bearing steel part, the case hardening 
treatment or increasing alloy content can be introduced [1,3].  
The spheroidization  treatment plays a critical role in  the 
manufacturing  process of this sort of hypereutectoid steels. 
Because proeutectoid  cementite can easily be formed at prior 
austenite grain boundaries on cooling, and hence resulting an 
inappropriate mi crostructure in terms of rolling contact  resistance. 
The spheroidization treatment before machining and hardening

microstructure and so enhance rolling wear resistance [1,3,6 -
7].Previous studies [8-9] showed that the bearing steels with 
bainitic matrices or tempered at relatively higher temperatures 
martensitic microstructures yield advantageous wear resistant 
parts for the applications that mentioned above. There was a lack 
of harder counterpart condition in dry sliding contact pairs in 
those studies. In this study, bearing steels heat treated in various 
conditions were tribologically tested in dry sliding against 
alumi na and 100Cr6 counterpart .  
The main purpose of this study was to evaluate heat  treated 
bearing steels in wear test against harder ceramic counterparts to 
see if there are any difference between them in terms of wear 
resistance under the tribological loading, which is mainly driven 
by abrasive wear mechanism rather than adhesive one that 
compared in previous studies [8 -9]. A recently published novel 
method [11 -12] enables to obtain profilometric measurements on 
wear track with precise volumetric wear loss values calculating 
from the  math formulae based on the  track profile geometry 
formed during  the wear test.  
 
 
2. Experimental  
 
2.1. Heat treatment  and surface preparation  
 
The working material in the experimental  study, Fe -0.95C -
0.21Si -0.36Mn -1.44Cr is a well -known AISI 52100 grade alloy 
and commonly used as bearing steel in wide vari ety applications. 
The delivered specimens from a local supplier cut up into slices 
had dimensions of 12 -15 mm in height and 40 mm.  
The austenization  treatment at 900°C for ½ h was applied to 
all specimens, followed by water quenching to room temperature 
(RT) without cracking in their structures, whose dimensions could 
compensate this sort of supercooling. The specimens were split 
into three groups in which they were heat treated with various 
parameters as listed in Table 1. The specimens were then polished  
and etched for microscopic investigation. Nital  (vol.% -3) was 
used as  the etchant . Their hardness values were measured on 
metallographically prepared surfaces using Vickers method under 
a load of 10 kg -f.  
The g roup of G1 specimens was heat treated to obt ain a 
spheroidized  cementite structure very finely distributed in  the 
ferritic  matrix instead of regular pearlitic formation  (see Fig. 1) . 
For this purpose, they were tempered or let’s say austenized  at 
795°C for ½ h and then furnace temperature set to 680 °C with a 
cooling rate of 370 K/h. The second leg of cooling was continued 
in the furnace  with the self-cooling  condition to RT.  This group 
has the lowest  hardness and is however used as reference 
materials for the calculation of math equations.   The g roup of G2 specimens was tempered at 400°C and their 
microstructures consist of typical tempered martensite structure 
(Fig. 2).  The backscattered electron imaging with compositional 
mode (BEI/C) in Fig. 2 reveals the randomly oriented patches of 
tempered marte nsite structure with a distributed carbide grains in 
dark contrast.   
The g roup of G3 specimen showed slightly tempered and 
stress relieved martensitic matrix with some additions of retained 
austenite in its microstructural investigation, due to relatively 
lower tempering temperature (200°C), as seen in BEI/C mode 
scanning electron micro scope  (SEM) image (see Fig. 3 ).

2.2. Wear test and characterization  
 
For wear characterization, “ball -on-disk” type sliding test in 
dry condition according to ASTM G99 -05 Standard  [10] were 
carried out using a tribometer from Nanovea. Apart  from previous 
studies [8 - 9], two variants as counterpart were used against flat 
AISI 52100 bearing steel specimens. These counterparts a re pure 
alumina and DIN 100Cr6 ( equivalent to AISI 52100) steel balls. 
Related details for the dry sliding test are  listed i n Table 2. The 
flat specimens were tested in dry sliding condition afterward  
metallographic  preparation procedures and cleaned with acetone. 
After the tribological test, the worn surfaces of both flat bearing 
steel specimens and the ball-shaped  counterpart s were examined 
in the optical  microscope and their worn volumes were calculated 
using novel optical profilometric techniques as described in 
previous studies [11 -12].  
 
 
3. Results and Discussion  
 
The change in coefficient of friction (COF) values with 
sliding distance during tests were presented in Fig. 4. Sliding pairs 
of various bearing steel specimens against 100Cr6 counterpart 
balls (Fig. 4a) yielded slightly different friction levels in first half 
of the total sliding distance, but almost same at the  second part of 
it. Their kinematic COF values were about 0.25 in steady state 
condition. Their frictional behavio r against alumina ceramic 
counterpart balls resembles previous ones but the average COF 
values yielded around 0.20 in steady state condition. In both 
cases, G2 specimens yielded lower COF values than that of 
others, particularly at the first half of the test distance.  
As stated before, the sliding surfaces were cleaned at the 
beginning. That means the counterpart ball slides on a very 
smooth fla t specimen surface at the initial period of wear test. 
However, the maximum Hertzian contact pressure values for test 
pairs under given tribological test conditions, point out that the 
dry sliding test starts with a plastic deformation on flat specimen 
surfaces . For example , G1, G2 or G3  specimen s against 100Cr6 , 
suffer from a maximum Hertzian contact pressure  level of 2238.5 
MPa , while having a shear stress  level of 694 MPa  under 38 µm 
depth of their original surface s, according to the calculated 
results . On the other hand , same specimens against alumina 
counterpart balls  are exposed to a maximum Hertzian contact pressure level of 2341.7 MPa , while having a shear stress level of 
726 MPa  under 38 µm depth of their original surface.   
 
Fig. 3. Etched microstr ucture of G3 specimen in SEM (BEI/C 
mode) shows mainly martensitic structure with some retained 
austenite revealed in light gray contrast between wedge type 
martensite plates  
 
There is obviously elastopla stic contact between test pairs in 
all conditions. Briefly, the hard and spherical counterpart (the 
ball) indents the relatively soft and flat specimen surface at the 
beginning and then it is forced to slide. It turns into predominantly 
abrasive wear [14] under these circumstances. Since the G1 
specimen has  relatively lower hardness  and hence a better  
deformation capability , the micro -ploughing (Fig. 5) plays a 
critical role in this case both against hard steel and ceramic 
counterpart balls. G1 specimen s should, therefore,  have relatively 
deeper indentation effect on its surface ; that leads to higher 
friction and COF values,  at least during running -in period.  Its 
COF value against 100Cr6 counterpart yielded relatively higher 
than that of against ceramic one. Another wear mechanism, 
adhesion may play a critica l role here. Metal -metal pairs should 
have much more tendency to cold welding at given conditions, 
than that of metal -ceramic pairs. Likewise , cold welding 
possibility in the latter case must be minimum due to their 
different material properties including bond structure, chemical 
stability etc. After  a running -in period, micro -cutting and work 
hardening  effect should be effective in G1 specimen -counterpart 
pairs. That yields a slight decrease in COF values as seen in Fig. 
4a and b.

Meanwhile, the debris formed at the interface should be partly 
oxidized and smeared throughout the wear track on the flat 
specimen surface. That means a third wear mechanism, the tribo -
corrosion [14] should also be effective as of steady -state period.

Due to its moderate hardness and microstructure of tempered 
martensite, G2 specimens do not plastically deform  as much as 
G1 specimens at the running -in period. When the inherent oxide 
film on both sliding pairs was broken and cleaned, the two/three 
body abrasion should be effective as predominant wear 
mechanism. Micro -cutting and work hardening effects play an 
important role in this period. The spalling  of partly oxidized 
debris parts , as well as work hardened and pa rtly micro -cracked 
regions from flat specimen surface,  are responsible for the wear  
losses in the steady -state period.  The G3 specimen was relatively hardest among others. 
Therefore, they should be more brittle and less plastically 
deformable  than others should. This may lead to a wear 
mechanism with the mixture of micro -cutting and micro -cracking, 
more or less in  the running -in period. When it is covered with 
partly oxidized debris, the surface should have a protective layer 
and hence not increase anymore  through the steady -state period.  
The counterpart materials effect on tribological response can 
be outlined that they did not change the tribological conditions 
fundamentally, but probably amended the weight ratio between 
mixed mechanisms, e.g. adhesive w ear in the pairs of metal -
ceramic counterparts should be less effective than that of metal -
metal ones, thus leading to a decrease in COF values in dry 
sliding tests.  
The tribological test results calculated from direct 
microscopic measurements were listed  in Table 3. COF values 
were calculated as average values from sliding test result tables. 
Volume loss values were determined from cross -sectional profiles 
for each specimen. The selected wear track  profiles measured 
using optical microscope is given in Fi g. 5.  The width level of 
wear tracks belongs to metal -ceramic pairs seem to be wider than 
that of metal -metal pairs. It must be noted that ceramic 
counterpart balls have  a bigger  diameter  (see Table 2 ). Equally 
spaced six cross -sectional profiles for every  wear track were 
measured and used for calculation of worn volume loss values as 
required by the ASTM standard G99 -05 [10]. Although there 
were important amount of wear on flat specimens, which are not 
presumed in related math formulae  described by ASTM G9 9-05 
Standard , the worn volume in counterpart balls were still 
calculated by the se formulae, since it has been shown  in a 
previous study  [12] that the calculation error in this condition is 
less than 5% , generally . It must be noted that “the pil ing-up” 
formation (or so -called micro -ploughing effect) on both sides of 
worn track profile could also be easily defined  if there any . This 
piling-up formation [13 -14] implies that there is plastic 
deformation during indentation of the counterpart ball tip into to 
flat specimen surface.  
The most wear resistance was obtained in G3 specimens as 
expected and as found in a previous  study [9], in which the 
volume loss values were determined using a different method. G2 
specimens yielded lower wear resistance than G3 again st both 
counterpart types, but the difference between them is quite small 
and additionally wear loss in counterpart is much more 
advantageous in G2 specimens vs. steel/ceramic ball pairs, than 
those with G3 specimens, in all circumstances. Likewise, the CO F 
values are also relatively lower in G2 specimens particularly at 
first half of the sliding tests (see Fig. 4). It implies that dry sliding 
between G2 and counterpart pairs brings much more 
advantageous lower friction during first 40 -50 m of total distanc e, 
but eventually the worn debris formed covers throughout the

depending on counterpart  type.

The worn track investigations show that the wear mechanisms 
were a mixture of abrasive and adhesive in given sliding pairs. In 
Fig. 6a, the worn surfaces of the G2 specimen and its 100Cr6 
counterpart are shown. Abrasive tracks and smeared debris layers 
are evident. Worn tip of the counterpart has a regular and circular shaped contour. Fig. 6b shows the worn track surface of the flat 
G2 specimen and its alumina ball worn  tip at left-hand  corner. 
The wid th value is wider than that of the G2 -100Cr6 pair, but 
adhesive and abrasive wear marks are clear.

alumina counterpart (b) shown at upper left corner  
 
The worn surface examinations i n G3 specimens gave same 
wear characteristics with G2 specimens in terms of wear 
mechanisms, which are a mixture  of adhesive and abrasive ones. 
It is possible to see, for example,  abrasive wear tracks in Fig. 7a, 
as well as some debris (dark regions), smea red at the interface. 
The wear track width of G3 specimen worn against ceramic 
counterpart is wider than that of specimen worn against 100Cr6 
ball (Fig. 7b).  
If the wear volume amounts of counterparts in Table 3 are 
considered, G2 specimens look  like bett er and more advantageous 
than that of other group specimens  since their volume loss 
amounts are either lower or almost equal to that of G1 specimens, 
which are not wear - resistant specimens. In other words, the 
sliding pairs including G2 specimens yielded minimum wear loss 
in total including flat and counterpart specimens than that of 
particularly G3 specimens and their sliding pairs. This situation 
can also be observed in COF -total sliding distance diagrams

Bhadeshia [1] reported a study from Paland  [15] in which a 
diagram was presented. This diagram showed the change of 
fretting -corrosion  induced weight loss with the hardness of 
materials tested, in given test conditions. In the scope of the 
present work, volume loss data were exami ned in terms of the 
effect of specimen hardness at different tribological conditions. 
The resulting diagram concerning the interrelation mentioned 
above was exhibited in Fig. 8. This relation was evaluated in two 
separate  data series in which two different  counterparts used 
against bearing steel specimens. Therefore, two different data 
series and their trendline functions calculated by MS Excel were 
placed. Using logarithmic axes on both sides and exponential 
functions, a linear interrelation between volume  loss and 
materials’ hardness with high determination coefficients (R² 
values) were obtained.

4. Conclusions  
 
AISI 52100 is a well -known bearing s teel and used frequently 
wear resistant alloy needed applications, where hardness, wear 
resistance, fatigue resistance, last but not least toughness are 
demanded. Spheroidization treatment is a key step in 
manufacturing this group of alloys before hardenin g and 
tempering in order to eliminate secondary carbide network at 
prior austenite grain boundaries and hence to increase wear 
resistance. Hardening through a martensitic matrix in 
microstructure is one of the methods to obtain a wear resistant 
steel struc ture but its lack of toughness is a major  shortcoming in 
these group of steel alloys. There are plenty of studies indicating 
the advantageous use of bainitic or tempered martensitic 
structures in wear resistant applications [1,8 -9].  
In this study,  metal -metal and metal -ceramic interactions in 
dry sliding pairs were examined and their interrelations and 
equations determined with high determination coefficients. 
According to results obtained, the foll owing conclusions were 
outlined:  
• Wear mechanisms were char acterized as a mixture  of 
abrasive, adhesive and tribo -corrosion types on all worn 
surfaces. However, abrasive wear is predominant one 
among them. Micro -ploughing and micro -cutting induced 
track formation in friction directions are evident for 
abrasive wea r, while smeared and then partly spalled  debris 
layers for adhesive and tribo -corrosion wear .  
• The change in counterpart material from steel to ceramic did 
not affect wear phenomenon on flat specimen surfaces 
fundamentally. According to results, there were  differences 
in the amount  of volume loss, contact area,  the ratio of 
adhesive wear mechanism in total wear behavior , etc. But 
the predominant mechanism was abrasion in both 
counterpart types.  
• G3 specimens yielded best wear resistance in given 
tribologica l conditions, but their counterparts worn  at most 
in comparison with other counterparts.  
• G2 specimens showed quite close performance in wear 
resistance to G3 specimens, moreover,  their counterparts 
showed equal or lesser to that of G1 specimens, which had  a 
quite  soft structure for machining purposes.

considered, G2 specimens yielded better and more 
advantageous results than others in terms of volume loss 
amounts of both flat specimens and ball shaped 
counterparts, in which the COF values are lowest among 
others at first half part of the dry sliding tests.  
• The bearing steel specimens heat -treated in various 
conditions were divided groups and tested against ceramic 
and steel counterparts. The volume loss in flat specimens 
was mathematically defined with a function of their 
hardness under given tribological conditions. The resulting 
equations represent the interrelations with high 
determination coefficients and successfully.

Abstract  
The mechanical properties of steel determine its applicability for a particular condition. Heat 
treatment is one such process that commonly enhances the properties of steel.  The previous 
researchers have concentrated mainly on austempering and Martempering of AISI steels. 
However to t he best of authors’ knowledge no work has yet been conducted on the tempering 
of AISI 52100 alloy steel.  Thus the present research endeavor is one such attempt  to study 
the effect of heat treatment on the mechanical properties of AISI 52100 alloy steel. D ifferent 
tests like compression, hardness, impact and wear have been carried out after the tempering at 
250˚C, 350˚C, 450˚C and 550˚C respectively.  The tests are conducted as per ASTM 
standards.  It is observed that the as -received AISI samples possess high  carbide content 
which makes them hard, whereas the tempering reduces the carbide content indicating less 
hardness. The impact tests revealed that the impact strength of the tempered samples 
increased when compared to the as -received specimens. Moreover,  approximately 50 –60% 
wear resistance was improved with tempering of AISI steel . However,  the elasticity and 
Ductility values showed a decreasing -increasing trend which is typical of tool steels of this 
class. The applications of AISI 52100 steel include bearing manufacture, ball screws, and 
gauges. Based on the functional requirement, the choice can be made among the tempered 
AISI 52100 steels.  
 
Keywords : AISI steel, tempering, compression, hardness, impact, wear.  
 
1. INTRODUCTION  
 Steels can be subjected to  variety of conventional heat treatments like normalizing, 
hardening and tempering. Th e knowledge of materials and their properties is of great 
importance for a production engineer. The machine elements should be endowed with 
materials that possess propert ies suitable for withstanding different operating conditions.  For 
example, AISI 52100 is a high carbon alloy steel which achieves a high degree of hardness 
with compressive strength and abrasion resistance used in ball and roller bearings, spinning tools, punch and dies. In such cases, to bring about the required properties heat treatment 
methods are commonly used. The combined effect of heating and cooling operations 
performed in a metal or alloy in the solid state is termed as heat treatment. The high 
temperature austenite phase possesses a unique property to transform into diversified room 
temperature phases like coarse pearlite, martensite, and bainite depending upon cooling cycle 
[1-3]. These phases possibly are decomposition products like ferrite & cem entite or may be 
super saturated solid solutions. The factors such as plate thickness and interlammer spacing 
between ferrite and cementite phases in pearlite, greatly influence property and performance 
of steels. In case of the plate thickness and interla mmer spacing between ferrite and cementite 
being large; coarser will be the pearlite and ferrite, thereby increasing ductility. This is 
attainable by slow cooling of the austenitic phase to room temperature, accordingly the 
treatment is known as annealing [4-7].  If the austenitic phase is cooled at a slightly faster 
rate, the decomposition of austenite by the eutectoid reaction will be available to form finer 
pearlite with increase in weight percentage of eutectoid mixture (pearlite), this kind of 
treatmen t is known as normalizing [8 -11]. Here the degree of dispersion of ferrite and 
cementite in pearlite increases to improve the machinability with finer grain size. The 
normalized steel contains nearly 50 wt % of pearlite and 50 wt % of proeutectoid ferrite.  If 
the austenitic phase is cooled in such a way that the cooling rate is greater than or equal to 
critical cooling rate (CCR), the transformed phase is termed as martensite. It is supersaturated 
single phase with body centered tetragonal (BCT) structure. The BCT structure has got a c/a 
ratio higher with more trapped carbon in the lattice. Thus there is increase in hardness and 
strength with considerable amount of thermal stresses because of quenching severity. To 
decrease the c/a ratio of BCT martensite, t o improve toughness, to convert retained austenite 
into stable phases; to saturate the non -equilibrium BCT martensitic structure and to minimize 
the thermal stresses induced during hardening, tempering treatment is given. Depending upon 
the tempering tempe rature and duration, the improvement in toughness is achievable with the 
sacrifice of hardness and strength. Because of high brittleness, as quenched spring steels are 
seldom used for practical applications [12, 13]. By tempering process, the properties of  
quenched steel could be modified to improve its impact resistance. Amid tempering, the 
resulting microstructure contains bainite or epsilon carbide in a matrix of ferrite depending on 
the tempering temperature.   
Mandal et al. [12] investigated the in fluence of austempering on the mechanical 
properties and microstructure of silicon alloyed cast steel. The experimental results showed that, ausferrite structure consisting of bainitic ferrite and austenite could be retained by 
austempering the steel for dif ferent austempering temperature. MacIejewski and Regulski 
[13] conducted studies on the fracture assessment of martempered, quenched and tempered 
AISI 4140 low alloy steel. It was concluded that the  advantages of Martempering  include less 
distortion, elimi nation of cracking, improved fatigue, and improved impact energy. Lerner 
and Kingsbury [14] conducted dry sliding and abrasive wear experiments on Austempered 
Ductile Iron (ADI) in order to examine the potential applications of this material for wear 
parts , as an alternative to steels and other competitive materials. It was observed that ADI 
possessed excellent wear properties, combined with their relatively low -friction coefficient 
and could be potentially used for dry sliding wear applications. In abrasiv e wear mode, the 
wear rate of ADI was comparable to that of alloyed hardened AISI 4340 steel, and relatively 
one-half that of hardened medium carbon AISI 1050 steel. Jetley [15] reported improvement 
in tribological characters of aircra ft brake steel rotors  by Martempering. Martempering 
process was done by oil - and water -based quench ants at lower temperature. The samples 
were tested for hardness, distortion, and wear. The results showed that both hardness and 
wear resistances were lower when compared to the  austempering, and also met the design 
intent. However, to the best of the authors’ observations, there have been few reports on 
tempering behavior of AISI 52100. The objective of the present study is to investigate the 
effect of the tempering on the micro structure and mechanical properties of AISI 52100, 
providing reference for its various industrial applications.  
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS  
The chemical composition of medium carbon steel samples used for this investigation is 
given in the following Table 1.  
2.1 Test specimen preparation  
The material used for this study is AISI 52100 possessing a carbon content of about 1.10% 
carbon. The specimens were then prepared for a compression tests for finding out various 
parameters such as percentage reduction in length and Modulus of Elasticity using a standard 
format of ASTM. The tests were carried out by a Universal testing machine using prepared 
specimens.  
2.2 Heat treating the medium carbon steel  
Standard heat treatment procedures were adapted to heat treat the AISI stee l. Five different 
samples were prepared for each operation and the average values were calculated based on 
the analysis made . 2.3 Hardening Process  
The specimens to be hardened were placed inside the furnace and heated to a temperature of 
9000C. The samples we re retained at this temperature for a period of one hour (because of its 
mass) during which the transformation must have been completed. Hardening operation was 
carried out on five steel samples having the same dimensions.  
Table 1 - Chemical composition of AISI 52100 . 
 
2.3 Tempering Process   
Tempering consists of reheating of the quenched steel to a suitable temperature which is 
below the transformation temperature for a considerable amount of time and then cooling 
back to room temperature. This process permits microstructure modifications for reducing 
hardness to a desired level thereby increasing its ductili ty. Tempering results in a desired 
combination of ductility, hardness, toughness, strength and structural stability. The desired 
properties and structures depend on tempering temperature and time. Tempering of the 
quenched specimens was carried out in a mu ffle furnace for about one hour. Experimental 
heat treatment cycles for selective alloy is hardening and followed by tempering are done at 
2500C increased by 1000C to 5500C for each tempering time interval.  
 
2.4 Mechanical test  
After these treatments, mechanical properties of the specimens were examined i.e. hardness, 
compressive strength, Impact and wear test and percentage of elongation.  
 
2.6 Compression test specimen  
The compression test specimens were prepared as per ASTM C39 standards. A rectangul ar 
block of size 35×20×18.5mm was prepared for this purpose.  For tensile properties, standard 
tensile specimens were loaded into a 600 -kN universal testing machine  testing machine 
hooked up to a data logger. Load -elongation data were recorded and converted  into stress -
strain graphs. Material properties such as % reduction in length, Young’s Modulus (E) have 
been determined. The dimensions of the test specimen for compression are as shown in 
Figure 1.

Impact Toughness ( J) was recorded using the Izode  impact tester. A block of 75×10×10 mm 
is prepared.  For yielding the Izode impact testing machine, a V -notch angled 45 degrees at a 
distance of 27.5 mm  along the length of the specimen at a depth of 2.54 mm along its depth 
from the top end of the specime n is grooved. The detailed dimensions are as shown in Figure

2.9 Wear test specimen  
Abrasive wear of the specimens is measured using DUCOM abrasion tribometer according to 
ASTM G65 with application of 5 kg load at 200 rev/min. Dry sliding test is conducted on pin 
disc apparatus against EN32 steel disc having hardness of 470Hv to measure c oefficient of 
friction based on standard ASTM G99. The dimensions of the specimen are 6mm in diameter 
and 30mm in length.

2.10 Hardness test  
The hardness of specimens was measured with the aid of Rockwell method. The specimens 
were brought in  contact with the indenter .The hardness of a specimen is indicated by the 
penetration of the indenter on the said specimen  and displayed in dial of the ma chine. Indents 
were made on the polished surfaces using a 150kg load for HRC scale.  
 
3. Results and Discussions  
The resulting values are obtained from the hardness test and compression tests and plotted in 
the Figures 5 to 9 showing the range of tempering temperature and the variation of 
mechanical properties such as hardness and Modulus of Elasticity etc. The data generated 
from these graphs for each of the heat treated specimens were analyzed i.e. hardening at 
9000C and tempered at different tempering temperature 2500C to 5500C. The data clearly 
shows a decrease in hardness with increase in tempering temperature. V ariation of hardness 
against tempering temperature for each heat treatment sequence is shown in Figure 5. As 
tempering temperature increases, hardness then gradually decreases. It has been a general 
observation for steels that hardness decreases with highe r tempering temperatures. However, 
the increasing -decreasing trend seen here for AISI 52100 steel is in line with typical behavior 
of high -strength hot -work tool steels, especially H -category steels [16]. For all the cases the 
hardness values are quite clo se to each other, indicating that difference in heat treatment 
sequence does not have a significant effect on hardness.  The decrease in hardness is due to 
decrease in c/a ratio of martensite during tempering. The marginal decrease in hardness 
shows the ina dequate tempering duration which is 1 hour. This is due to the relaxation of the 
BCT martensitic cell i.e. the drastic reduction in c/a ratio of martensite. Figure 6 shows that 
with an increase in tempering temperature, impact toughness increases. The maxi mum value 
for impact toughness was observed at tempering temperature of 550 0C which construes the 
fact that high tempering  temperatures play a dominant role in behavior of impact toughness 
while compared to lower tempering temperatures. Th e average wear v olume loss of heat 
treated samples with respect to time in dry sliding test is presented in Figure 7. The bar graph 
clearly indicates that as the tempering temperature increases, the wear volume loss gradually 
decreases. The as-received specimen had consid erable amount of burr formation at the end 
which was kept on the tungsten disc. This indicates that a lot of heat was formed at the end 
which deformed the portion of that end plastically. Also this suggests that the material was 
more ductile than that of t he remaining samples.  Graphs portraying the variation of ductility 
(represented here as percent reduction) against tempering temperature for each heat treatment 
sequence are shown in Figure 8.  The Ductility suddenly increases as tempering temperature 
incre ases up to 2500C, and then starts to decrease rather sharply at 3500 C. This decreasing - 
increasing trend of ductility variation is typical of steels of this class. A huge difference exists 
between the ductility values for as -received and 2500C tempered specimen. Even though a 
huge difference is existing in these values for as -bought, tempered specimens, the fracture 
behavior of hardened specimen is totally different [17, 18]. This is the evidence for the 
formation of brittle supersaturated sol id solution of martensite. This also justifies that the as -
bought specimen is hot worked. This increase in ductility is due to the increase in weight % 
of pro -eutectoid ferrite which is coarse in size.  Figure 9 shows the variation of Modulus of 
elasticity (E) against tempering temperature. It is interesting to note that Elasticity first 
increases (for 2500C), then decreases (from 2500C to 3500C) and then gradually increase for higher tempering temperatures. Generally, a significant effect of heat treatment type on 
elasticity values is observed, where all the tempered specimens show a notable offset from 
each other.

Conclusions  
 
AISI 52100 steel was subjected to various heat treatments for enhancing the material 
properties. From the present study the following conclusions are drawn.  
• The as-received  AISI samples have high carbide content which makes them hard, 
whereas tempered samples reduce carbide content indicating less hardness.  
• Tempered samples have highest impact strength, the least being for as -received 
specimen . The impact  strength increased with  increase in tempering temperature  up to 
certain level  20%. 
• The tempered  samples lead to lowest  wear  volume loss , while as-received samples 
had the highest wear volume loss . Approximately 50 –60% wear resistance is 
increased with temperi ng process.  
• The Elasticity and  Ductility  values showed a decreasing -increasing trend which is 
typical of tool steels of this class . 
Based on functional requirement, the choice can be made among the tempered  AISI 52100 
steels.

The objective of this  research  was  to  investigate  the  bainitic  formation  in  austempered  SAE
52100  steel.  The  original  microstructure  of  SAE  52100  steel  consisted  of  spheroidized  pearlite.
In the  formation  of  bainite,  SAE  52100  steel  samples  were  austenitized  at  a  temperature  of
849◦C  for  20  min,  and  then  quickly  quenched  to  the  isothermal  temperatures  between  232◦C
and 427◦C  for  various  holding  times  from  20  s  to  120  min.  The  hardness  and  microstructure
of austempered  SAE  52100  samples  were  analyzed  using  a  Rockwell  C  hardness  tester  and
metallurgical optical  microscope.  In  addition,  the  bainitic  formation  in  SAE  52100  steel  was

1.  Introduction
SAE 52100  is  an  alloy  steel  with  high  carbon  with  chromium
as  an  alloying  element,  which  has  been  widely  applied  in
rolling bearings  [1].  The  traditional  heat  treatment  process  for
SAE  52100  steel  consists  of  a  quenching  process  followed  by
a tempering  step  at  low  temperature.  The  resulting  tempered
martensite  microstructure  provides  SAE  52100  steel  with  high
strength  and  high  fatigue  resistance  [2].
An isothermal  heat  treatment  process  has  been  suggested
as  an  alternative  process  to  produce  bainite  microstructure
in  order  to  provide  excellent  mechanical  properties  includ-
ing high  toughness,  strength  and  wear  resistance  [3,4] .  The

bainite  in  terms  of  the  carbide  precipitation.  In  upper  bai-
nite, most  of  the  carbide  is  present  within  the  interface
between  ferritic  sheaves.  In  lower  bainite,  most  of  the  car-
bide is  formed  inside  the  ferritic  platelets  without  any  carbon
transfer [5–7] .
Krishna  et  al.  [8]  investigated  the  impact  toughness  and
wear  resistance  of  austempered  SAE  52100  steel  produced  at
an austempering  temperature  of  340◦C  with  holding  dura-
tions  of  10  min,  20  min  and  30  min.  They  found  that  the
impact toughness  of  austempered  SAE  52100  steel  specimens
increased  when  they  extended  the  holding  duration  due  to
the  presence  of  more  bainitic  structure  in  the  matrix.  In  their
abrasion wear  test,  the  wear  loss  of  austempered  specimens
was  much  lower  than  that  of  annealed  specimens.  Kar  et  al.
[9] applied  a  two-cycle  austenitizing  process  (1st  austenitizing
step: 1150◦C,  60  min;  2nd  austenitizing  step:  900◦C,  20  min)

followed  by  an  isothermal  thermal  heat  treatment  step  at
255◦C  with  a  holding  time  of  60  min  on  SAE  52100  steel.
Finally, they  reported  that  using  the  two-cycle  austenitizing
process  could  result  in  doubling  of  the  fracture  toughness  as
compared  with  conventional  quenched  and  tempered  heat
treatment. Kilicli  et  al.  [10]  demonstrated  that  varying  austem-
pering temperature was  more  effective  than  varying  holding
time in  isothermal  heat  treatment  on  the  fraction  of  bainite
produced  in  SAE  52100  steel.  Bainite  +  martensite  microstruc-
ture was  found  to  yield  high  levels  of  hardness  (55–64  HRC)
and  enhanced  impact  toughness  (24–54  Joule).  Sari  et  al.  [11]
found that nitrogen and  carbon  dioxide  ion  implantation
could be  used  to  modify  the  mechanical  properties  of  a  wide
range of  metals  and  alloys  using  plasma  techniques  for  ion
sources  and  plasma  surface  treatment.  The  hardness  of  SAE
52100  samples  could  be  increased  30–49%  using  N  +  2  ions,
and 5–17%  using  co2+  ions.  Chakraborty  et  al.  [12]  found  that
an optimum  austempering  process  (270◦C,  30  min)  followed
by water quenching can  develop  a  bainite  +  martensite  duplex
microstructure
 and  improved  levels  of  hardness  (62HRC)  and
tensile (2250  MPa)  and  impact  strength  (53  J).
In the  past  two  decades,  researchers  have  investigated
the  mechanical  properties  of  austempered  SAE  52100  steel.
However, few  researchers  thoroughly  studied  the  formation
and morphological  transformation  of  bainitic  structure  in  the
matrix  of  SAE  52100.  In  this  study,  eight  austempering  tem-
peratures and  twenty-three  holding  times  were  utilized  for
detailed  analysis.  The  Rockwell  hardness  and  microstructure
were  studied  using  a  hardness  tester  and  optical  microscopy.
Also, the  transformation  kinetics  of  bainitic  formation  are
characterized  in  this  research.
2.  Experimental  procedure
2.1.  Chemical  composition
The chemical  composition  of  the  SAE  52100  steel  used  in  this
research  is  shown  in  Table  1.
2.2. Heat treatment  process
2.2.1. As-received SAE  52100  steel
The  microstructure  of  as-received  SAE  52100  steel  is  shown  in
Fig. 1.  It  can  be  seen  that  the  spherodized  carbide  is  uniformly
distributed  in the  ferrite  substrate.
2.2.2. Isothermal  heat  treatment  process
The  fully  spherodized  SAE  52100  steel  cylindrical  specimens
with a diameter of  15  mm  and  thickness  of  10  mm  were  ﬁrst

Fig. 2 –  Sketch  of  Heat  Treatment  Process.
austenitized  at  850◦C  (1560◦F)  for  20  min  in  a  salt  bath  fur-
nace.  Then  the  fully  austenitized  specimens  were  rapidly
transferred to  another  salt  bath  furnace  for  the  austemper-
ing step.  Eight  different  austempering  temperatures  of  232◦C
(450◦F),  260◦C  (500◦F),  288◦C  (550◦F),  316◦C  (600◦F),  343◦C
(650◦F),  371◦C  (700◦F),  399◦C  (750◦F)  and  427◦C  (800◦F)  and
twenty-three holding  times  of  20  s,  40  s,  60  s,  80  s,  100  s,  120  s,
150  s,  180  s,  210  s,  240  s,  270  s,  300  s,  360  s,  420  s,  480  s,  540  s,
570  s,  600  s,  1200  s,  1800  s,  3600  s,  5400  s  and  7200  s  were  used,
respectively. The  austempered  specimens  were  cooled  to  room
temperature  by  water  quenching.  The  sketch  of  the  heat  treat-
ment  process  is  shown  in  Fig.  2.  The  molten  salt  bath  furnaces
were used  in  this  research  in  order  to  eliminate  or  minimize
the  effects  of  any  oxidation  and  decarburization.
2.3. Rockwell  hardness  measurement
The hardness of  the  austempered  SAE  52100  steel  specimens
were  measured  using  a  Rockwell  C  hardness  tester.  The  spec-
imens  were  ground  and  polished  to  produce  smooth  and
ﬂat  surfaces  for  accurate  measurements.  The  hardness  mea-
surement on  each  specimen  was  repeated  three  times  and
averages were  reported.j  m  a  t  e  r  r  e  s  t  e  c  h  n  o  l  .  2  0  1  9;8(5) :4569–4576  4571

2.4. Metallurgical  evaluation
The  cylindrical  specimens  were  hot  mounted  using  polymer
resin powder.  The  surfaces  of  the  mounted  specimens  were
ground using  SiC  sandpaper  ranging  from  240-grit  to  1200-grit
and  polished  using  0.05  /H9262m  Al2O3suspension  to  a  mirror-
like ﬁnish.  Then,  the  mounted  specimens  were  etched  using
3% nital solution  for  approximately  2  s  to  3  s.  Finally,  optical
microscopy  was  used  to  observe  the  microstructure  of  the  SAE
52100 specimens.
3.  Results  and  discussion
3.1. Rockwell  C  hardness  measurement
The  hardness  measurements  of  austempered  SAE  52100  steel
specimens produced by  various  austempering  temperatures
and  holding  times  are  plotted  in  Fig.  3.  For  all  austem-
pering  temperatures,  it  was  found  that  the  hardness  drops
over a  certain  period  and  then  gradually  becomes  ﬂat.  The
holding  times  when  the  hardness  starts  to  drop  and  then
remains  ﬂat  are  deﬁned  as  the  beginning  and  ending  points
of the  bainitic  transformation  reaction  from  austenite.  The
beginning  point  of  bainitic  transformation  begins  earlier  withincreasing  austempering  temperature.  In  addition,  the  slope
of the  transition  period  became  larger  at  higher  austemper-
ing temperature.  This  is  because  the  rate  of  carbon  diffusion
is  accelerated  at  high  austempering  temperature.  The  rate  of
the transformation  reaction  was  also  accelerated  by  faster  dif-
fusion  of  carbon  at  high  temperature.
3.2.  Morphological  analysis  of  bainite
The microstructures of  austempered  SAE  52100  steel  speci-
mens  produced  by  various  austempering  temperatures  and
holding  times  are  shown  in  Fig.  4.  The  main  components  in
the matrix  are  bainite  (black  regions),  martensite  (dark  brown
regions)  and  retained  austenite  (light-colored  regions).  The
amount  of  bainite  increases  signiﬁcantly  when  using  longer
holding times. Eventually,  the  matrix  becomes  100%  bainite.
The  bainite  platelets  become  coarse  at  higher  austemper-
ing  temperatures.  The  bainite  produced  when  using  lower
austempering temperatures  between  232◦C  and  316◦C  con-
sists  of  narrow  needle-like  ferrite  sheaves.  However,  the
bainite  formed  at  higher  austempering  temperatures  of  372◦C
and 427◦C  are  considered  as  upper  bainite  due  to  formation  of
bainitic  islands  in  the  matrix.  Both  upper  and  lower  bainite  are4572  j  m  a  t  e  r  r  e  s  t  e  c  h  n  o  l  .  2  0  1  9;8(5) :4569–4576

3.3.  Transformation  kinetics  study
3.3.1.  Phase  transformation  fraction
The fraction of bainitic transformation  was  determined  by
using
 hardness  measurements,  see  Eq.  1.  In  Fig.  5,  it  can  be
seen  that  the  transformation  rate  increases  when  increasing
the austempering  temperatures.
Xt=H0−  Ht
H0−  Hf×  100%  (1)
Where:
Xt–  The  fraction  of  bainitic  transformation
H0–  The  initial  hardness,  which  corresponds  to  the  begin-
ning of  the  bainitic  transformation  reaction
Ht–  The  hardness  measured  at  a  speciﬁc  holding  time  dur-
ing the  bainitic  phase  transformation
Hf–  The  ﬁnal  hardness,  which  corresponds  to  the  end  of
the  bainitic  transformation  reaction
The “Avrami”  equation  (Eq.  2)  can  be  used  to  describe  the
relationship  between  the  phase  transformation  and  speciﬁc
holding durations.  For  each  austempering  temperature.
Xt=  1  −  exp(−ktn)  (2)
Where:

The above  Eq.  2  can  be  reorganized  as  follows  (Eq.s  3  and
4) to  determine  the  values  of  “k”  and  “n”.

The  values  of  “k”  and  “n”  were  obtained  from  the  plots  of
the organized “Avrami”  equation.  “k”  was  the  y  intercept  of  the
best  ﬁt line,  and  “n”  was  the  slope  of  the  regression  equation.
The  regression  equations  for  each  austempering  temperature
are shown  in  Fig.  6.
The  linear  regression  equations  for  each  austempering
temperature are  shown  in  Table  2.  The  values  of  “k”  and  “n”

3.3.2.  Activation  energy
The  activation  energy  is  the  minimum  energy  required  to  initi-
ate a  chemical  reaction.  According  to  the  “ Arrhenius”  equation
(Eq.  5),  the  activation  energy  for  both  upper  and  lower  bainite
was found  as  follows:
ke−Q/RT=  A  ×  (5)
Where:
k  –  Rate  coefﬁcient  of  the  transformation  reaction
A –  Reaction  frequency  factor  [1/s]
R  –  General  gas  constant  8.31  [J/mol  ×  K]
Q –  Activation  energy
T – Temperature  [K]
The  above  “Arrhenius”  equation  can  be  rewritten  as  shown
in  equation  6  to  determine  the  values  of  “Q”  and  “A”.  The  plots
of “lnk”  versus  “1/T”  are  shown  in  Fig.  7.
The  values  of  “Q”  and  “A”  can  be  determined  by  the  slope
of the  regression  line  and  intercept  with  Y  axis,  see  Table  4.

4. Summary and  conclusions
In this  research,  austempered  SAE  52100  steel  specimens  were
produced  using  various  austempering  temperatures  and  hold-
ing  times.  The  Rockwell  C  hardness  and  microstructure  of
bainitic SAE  52100  steel  were  evaluated.  Also,  the  transfor-
mation kinetics of  bainitic  formation  was  studied.  Several
conclusions  can  be  summarized  as  follows:
1 Lower  bainite  was  produced  using  austempering  temper-
atures  ranging  from  232◦C  (450◦F)  to  343◦C  (600◦F).  The
ferrite platelets  became  coarse  and  upper  bainite  was  pro-
duced whe  n  using  the  austempering  temperatures  of  372◦C
(700◦F)  and  427◦C  (800◦F).j  m  a  t  e  r  r  e  s  t  e  c  h  n  o  l  .  2  0  1  9;8(5) :4569–4576  4575

2  The  austempering  temperature  of  343◦C  (650◦F)  seemed  to
be the  threshold  since  both  lower  and  upper  bainite  could
be  found  in  the  matrix  produced  at  343◦C  (650◦F).
3  Hardness  decreased  when  increasing  either  isothermal
temperature or  holding  time.
4 The  beginning  of  the  bainitic  transformation  occurred  ear-
lier when increasing  the  austempering  temperature.
5  The  transformation rate of upper  bainite  was  higher  than
that
 in  lower  bainite.
6  The  activation  energy  required  for  the  formation  of  upper
bainite was  higher  than  that  for  lower  bainite.

Introduction

e knowledge of materials and their properties is of great
signi�canceforaproductionengineer.emachineelements
should be made of a material that has properties suitable to
the operating conditions. For instance, AISI 52100 is a highcarbon alloy steel which achieves a high degree of hardness
with compressive strength and abrasion resistance used in
ballandrollerbearings,spinningtools,punches,anddies.Insuchcases,toachievetherequiredpropertiesheattreatmentmethodsarecommonlyused.
Martempering is a common heat treatment process that
quenches the material to an intermediate temperature justabove the martensite start temperature (𝑀𝑀
𝑠𝑠)
and then cools
air through the martensitic transformation range to roomtemperature[1–4].Itisimportanttoair-coolthroughoutthetransformation range since rapid cooling through this rangeisrequiredtoproduceresidualstresspatternssimilartothose

austenite existing in the microstructure of these steels were
investigated. Specimens were austenitized at 950∘C followed
by direct quenching using compressed and still air. especimens were also isothermally quenched in salt bath at
200∘C and 300∘C for 2, 8, 30, and 120min. e existence
of the retained austenite in the microstructure of this steel
led to some drawbacks. Wear resistance of the material wasreducedasaresultofthepresenceofphasewithlowhardness
and strength. Unfavorable dimensional variations appear in
thespecimensresultingfromthetransformationofausteniteto martensite during tempering or upon severe impacts
applied to the liners during milling process. Transformation
of austenite to martensite during tempering gives rise toa volume change in austenite resulting in the formationof a severe compressive stress at the austenite-martensite
boundary. Such a defect forms a suitable place for crack
nucleationandthereforereducesdurabilityofthespecimen.e results showed that the lowest amount of retainedausteniteinthemicrostructurewasobtainedinthespecimens

e eﬀect of austempering treatment on microstructure

Wear resistance properties of Austempered Ductile Iron
(ADI)werestudiedbyLernerandKingsbury[9].Adetailed
review of wear resistance properties of ADI was undertaken
to examine the potential applications of this material forwear parts, as an alternative to steels, alloyed and white
irons, bronzes, and other competitive materials. Two modes
of wear were studied: adhesive (frictional) dry sliding andabrasivewear.Intherotatingdryslidingtests,wearbehaviorof the base material (a stationary block) was considered in
relationship to counter surface (steel sha) wear. In thisT1:CompositionofAISI52100Steel.

wear mode, the wear rate of ADI was only one-fourth that
of pearlitic ductile iron (DI). Only quenched DI with afully martensitic matrix slightly out performed ADI. No
signi�cantdiﬀerencewasobservedinthewearofsteelshas
running against ADI and quenched DI. e excellent wearperformance of ADI and its counter surface, combined withtheir relatively low-friction coeﬃcient, indicate potential for
dryslidingwearapplications.Intheabrasivewearmode,the
wearrateofADIwascomparabletothatofalloyedhardenedAISI4340steel,andapproximatelyone-halfthatofhardenedmedium carbon AISI 1050 steel and of white and alloyed
cast irons. e wear resistance of ADI may be attributed to
the strain-aﬀected transformation of high-carbon austeniteto martensite that takes place in the surface layer during theweartests.
Jetley [10] reported improvement in wear properties of
aircra brake steel rotors by martempering. Martemperingprocess using oil- and water-based quenchants at lowertemperature is adopted in this work. e test samples were
evaluated for hardness, distortion, and wear under acceler-
ated simulated tests. e results show that although bothhardness and wear resistances were lower compared to the
austempering,theymetthedesignintent.Alsothewearrate
of martempered samples was more consistent which mayprovideadvantagesformaintenancepurposes.
Wear of hard-turned AISI 52100 steel was studied by
Bartha et al. [11]. High precision machining such as hardturning changes the surface and the material properties ofsteelalloys.Aslidingblock-on-cylinderweartesterwasusedfor the purpose of testing the wear performance of AISI
52100-bearingsteel.eeﬀectofmicrostructureonthewear

on the surface hardness was attributed to this increase in
wear performance. e near-surface residual stress of thematerial was shown to become more compressive as thematerial wore down. e applied normal loads aﬀected the
surface roughness, residual stresses, and, in turn, the wear
performanceofthematerial.

Abstract  
The mechanical properties of steel determine its applicability for a particular condition. Heat 
treatment is one such process that commonly enhances the properties of steel.  The previous 
researchers have concentrated mainly on austempering and Martempering of AISI steels. 
However to t he best of authors’ knowledge no work has yet been conducted on the tempering 
of AISI 52100 alloy steel.  Thus the present research endeavor is one such attempt  to study 
the effect of heat treatment on the mechanical properties of AISI 52100 alloy steel. D ifferent 
tests like compression, hardness, impact and wear have been carried out after the tempering at 
250˚C, 350˚C, 450˚C and 550˚C respectively.  The tests are conducted as per ASTM 
standards.  It is observed that the as -received AISI samples possess high  carbide content 
which makes them hard, whereas the tempering reduces the carbide content indicating less 
hardness. The impact tests revealed that the impact strength of the tempered samples 
increased when compared to the as -received specimens. Moreover,  approximately 50 –60% 
wear resistance was improved with tempering of AISI steel . However,  the elasticity and 
Ductility values showed a decreasing -increasing trend which is typical of tool steels of this 
class. The applications of AISI 52100 steel include bearing manufacture, ball screws, and 
gauges. Based on the functional requirement, the choice can be made among the tempered 
AISI 52100 steels.  
 
Keywords : AISI steel, tempering, compression, hardness, impact, wear.  
 
1. INTRODUCTION  
 Steels can be subjected to  variety of conventional heat treatments like normalizing, 
hardening and tempering. Th e knowledge of materials and their properties is of great 
importance for a production engineer. The machine elements should be endowed with 
materials that possess propert ies suitable for withstanding different operating conditions.  For 
example, AISI 52100 is a high carbon alloy steel which achieves a high degree of hardness 
with compressive strength and abrasion resistance used in ball and roller bearings, spinning tools, punch and dies. In such cases, to bring about the required properties heat treatment 
methods are commonly used. The combined effect of heating and cooling operations 
performed in a metal or alloy in the solid state is termed as heat treatment. The high 
temperature austenite phase possesses a unique property to transform into diversified room 
temperature phases like coarse pearlite, martensite, and bainite depending upon cooling cycle 
[1-3]. These phases possibly are decomposition products like ferrite & cem entite or may be 
super saturated solid solutions. The factors such as plate thickness and interlammer spacing 
between ferrite and cementite phases in pearlite, greatly influence property and performance 
of steels. In case of the plate thickness and interla mmer spacing between ferrite and cementite 
being large; coarser will be the pearlite and ferrite, thereby increasing ductility. This is 
attainable by slow cooling of the austenitic phase to room temperature, accordingly the 
treatment is known as annealing [4-7].  If the austenitic phase is cooled at a slightly faster 
rate, the decomposition of austenite by the eutectoid reaction will be available to form finer 
pearlite with increase in weight percentage of eutectoid mixture (pearlite), this kind of 
treatmen t is known as normalizing [8 -11]. Here the degree of dispersion of ferrite and 
cementite in pearlite increases to improve the machinability with finer grain size. The 
normalized steel contains nearly 50 wt % of pearlite and 50 wt % of proeutectoid ferrite.  If 
the austenitic phase is cooled in such a way that the cooling rate is greater than or equal to 
critical cooling rate (CCR), the transformed phase is termed as martensite. It is supersaturated 
single phase with body centered tetragonal (BCT) structure. The BCT structure has got a c/a 
ratio higher with more trapped carbon in the lattice. Thus there is increase in hardness and 
strength with considerable amount of thermal stresses because of quenching severity. To 
decrease the c/a ratio of BCT martensite, t o improve toughness, to convert retained austenite 
into stable phases; to saturate the non -equilibrium BCT martensitic structure and to minimize 
the thermal stresses induced during hardening, tempering treatment is given. Depending upon 
the tempering tempe rature and duration, the improvement in toughness is achievable with the 
sacrifice of hardness and strength. Because of high brittleness, as quenched spring steels are 
seldom used for practical applications [12, 13]. By tempering process, the properties of  
quenched steel could be modified to improve its impact resistance. Amid tempering, the 
resulting microstructure contains bainite or epsilon carbide in a matrix of ferrite depending on 
the tempering temperature.   
Mandal et al. [12] investigated the in fluence of austempering on the mechanical 
properties and microstructure of silicon alloyed cast steel. The experimental results showed that, ausferrite structure consisting of bainitic ferrite and austenite could be retained by 
austempering the steel for dif ferent austempering temperature. MacIejewski and Regulski 
[13] conducted studies on the fracture assessment of martempered, quenched and tempered 
AISI 4140 low alloy steel. It was concluded that the  advantages of Martempering  include less 
distortion, elimi nation of cracking, improved fatigue, and improved impact energy. Lerner 
and Kingsbury [14] conducted dry sliding and abrasive wear experiments on Austempered 
Ductile Iron (ADI) in order to examine the potential applications of this material for wear 
parts , as an alternative to steels and other competitive materials. It was observed that ADI 
possessed excellent wear properties, combined with their relatively low -friction coefficient 
and could be potentially used for dry sliding wear applications. In abrasiv e wear mode, the 
wear rate of ADI was comparable to that of alloyed hardened AISI 4340 steel, and relatively 
one-half that of hardened medium carbon AISI 1050 steel. Jetley [15] reported improvement 
in tribological characters of aircra ft brake steel rotors  by Martempering. Martempering 
process was done by oil - and water -based quench ants at lower temperature. The samples 
were tested for hardness, distortion, and wear. The results showed that both hardness and 
wear resistances were lower when compared to the  austempering, and also met the design 
intent. However, to the best of the authors’ observations, there have been few reports on 
tempering behavior of AISI 52100. The objective of the present study is to investigate the 
effect of the tempering on the micro structure and mechanical properties of AISI 52100, 
providing reference for its various industrial applications.  
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS  
The chemical composition of medium carbon steel samples used for this investigation is 
given in the following Table 1.  
2.1 Test specimen preparation  
The material used for this study is AISI 52100 possessing a carbon content of about 1.10% 
carbon. The specimens were then prepared for a compression tests for finding out various 
parameters such as percentage reduction in length and Modulus of Elasticity using a standard 
format of ASTM. The tests were carried out by a Universal testing machine using prepared 
specimens.  
2.2 Heat treating the medium carbon steel  
Standard heat treatment procedures were adapted to heat treat the AISI stee l. Five different 
samples were prepared for each operation and the average values were calculated based on 
the analysis made . 2.3 Hardening Process  
The specimens to be hardened were placed inside the furnace and heated to a temperature of 
9000C. The samples we re retained at this temperature for a period of one hour (because of its 
mass) during which the transformation must have been completed. Hardening operation was 
carried out on five steel samples having the same dimensions.  
Table 1 - Chemical composition of AISI 52100 . 
 
2.3 Tempering Process   
Tempering consists of reheating of the quenched steel to a suitable temperature which is 
below the transformation temperature for a considerable amount of time and then cooling 
back to room temperature. This process permits microstructure modifications for reducing 
hardness to a desired level thereby increasing its ductili ty. Tempering results in a desired 
combination of ductility, hardness, toughness, strength and structural stability. The desired 
properties and structures depend on tempering temperature and time. Tempering of the 
quenched specimens was carried out in a mu ffle furnace for about one hour. Experimental 
heat treatment cycles for selective alloy is hardening and followed by tempering are done at 
2500C increased by 1000C to 5500C for each tempering time interval.  
 
2.4 Mechanical test  
After these treatments, mechanical properties of the specimens were examined i.e. hardness, 
compressive strength, Impact and wear test and percentage of elongation.  
 
2.6 Compression test specimen  
The compression test specimens were prepared as per ASTM C39 standards. A rectangul ar 
block of size 35×20×18.5mm was prepared for this purpose.  For tensile properties, standard 
tensile specimens were loaded into a 600 -kN universal testing machine  testing machine 
hooked up to a data logger. Load -elongation data were recorded and converted  into stress -
strain graphs. Material properties such as % reduction in length, Young’s Modulus (E) have 
been determined. The dimensions of the test specimen for compression are as shown in 
Figure 1.

Impact Toughness ( J) was recorded using the Izode  impact tester. A block of 75×10×10 mm 
is prepared.  For yielding the Izode impact testing machine, a V -notch angled 45 degrees at a 
distance of 27.5 mm  along the length of the specimen at a depth of 2.54 mm along its depth 
from the top end of the specime n is grooved. The detailed dimensions are as shown in Figure

2.9 Wear test specimen  
Abrasive wear of the specimens is measured using DUCOM abrasion tribometer according to 
ASTM G65 with application of 5 kg load at 200 rev/min. Dry sliding test is conducted on pin 
disc apparatus against EN32 steel disc having hardness of 470Hv to measure c oefficient of 
friction based on standard ASTM G99. The dimensions of the specimen are 6mm in diameter 
and 30mm in length.

2.10 Hardness test  
The hardness of specimens was measured with the aid of Rockwell method. The specimens 
were brought in  contact with the indenter .The hardness of a specimen is indicated by the 
penetration of the indenter on the said specimen  and displayed in dial of the ma chine. Indents 
were made on the polished surfaces using a 150kg load for HRC scale.  
 
3. Results and Discussions  
The resulting values are obtained from the hardness test and compression tests and plotted in 
the Figures 5 to 9 showing the range of tempering temperature and the variation of 
mechanical properties such as hardness and Modulus of Elasticity etc. The data generated 
from these graphs for each of the heat treated specimens were analyzed i.e. hardening at 
9000C and tempered at different tempering temperature 2500C to 5500C. The data clearly 
shows a decrease in hardness with increase in tempering temperature. V ariation of hardness 
against tempering temperature for each heat treatment sequence is shown in Figure 5. As 
tempering temperature increases, hardness then gradually decreases. It has been a general 
observation for steels that hardness decreases with highe r tempering temperatures. However, 
the increasing -decreasing trend seen here for AISI 52100 steel is in line with typical behavior 
of high -strength hot -work tool steels, especially H -category steels [16]. For all the cases the 
hardness values are quite clo se to each other, indicating that difference in heat treatment 
sequence does not have a significant effect on hardness.  The decrease in hardness is due to 
decrease in c/a ratio of martensite during tempering. The marginal decrease in hardness 
shows the ina dequate tempering duration which is 1 hour. This is due to the relaxation of the 
BCT martensitic cell i.e. the drastic reduction in c/a ratio of martensite. Figure 6 shows that 
with an increase in tempering temperature, impact toughness increases. The maxi mum value 
for impact toughness was observed at tempering temperature of 550 0C which construes the 
fact that high tempering  temperatures play a dominant role in behavior of impact toughness 
while compared to lower tempering temperatures. Th e average wear v olume loss of heat 
treated samples with respect to time in dry sliding test is presented in Figure 7. The bar graph 
clearly indicates that as the tempering temperature increases, the wear volume loss gradually 
decreases. The as-received specimen had consid erable amount of burr formation at the end 
which was kept on the tungsten disc. This indicates that a lot of heat was formed at the end 
which deformed the portion of that end plastically. Also this suggests that the material was 
more ductile than that of t he remaining samples.  Graphs portraying the variation of ductility 
(represented here as percent reduction) against tempering temperature for each heat treatment 
sequence are shown in Figure 8.  The Ductility suddenly increases as tempering temperature 
incre ases up to 2500C, and then starts to decrease rather sharply at 3500 C. This decreasing - 
increasing trend of ductility variation is typical of steels of this class. A huge difference exists 
between the ductility values for as -received and 2500C tempered specimen. Even though a 
huge difference is existing in these values for as -bought, tempered specimens, the fracture 
behavior of hardened specimen is totally different [17, 18]. This is the evidence for the 
formation of brittle supersaturated sol id solution of martensite. This also justifies that the as -
bought specimen is hot worked. This increase in ductility is due to the increase in weight % 
of pro -eutectoid ferrite which is coarse in size.  Figure 9 shows the variation of Modulus of 
elasticity (E) against tempering temperature. It is interesting to note that Elasticity first 
increases (for 2500C), then decreases (from 2500C to 3500C) and then gradually increase for higher tempering temperatures. Generally, a significant effect of heat treatment type on 
elasticity values is observed, where all the tempered specimens show a notable offset from 
each other.

Conclusions  
 
AISI 52100 steel was subjected to various heat treatments for enhancing the material 
properties. From the present study the following conclusions are drawn.  
• The as-received  AISI samples have high carbide content which makes them hard, 
whereas tempered samples reduce carbide content indicating less hardness.  
• Tempered samples have highest impact strength, the least being for as -received 
specimen . The impact  strength increased with  increase in tempering temperature  up to 
certain level  20%. 
• The tempered  samples lead to lowest  wear  volume loss , while as-received samples 
had the highest wear volume loss . Approximately 50 –60% wear resistance is 
increased with temperi ng process.  
• The Elasticity and  Ductility  values showed a decreasing -increasing trend which is 
typical of tool steels of this class . 
Based on functional requirement, the choice can be made among the tempered  AISI 52100 
steels.

Abstract  
The mechanical properties of steel determine its applicability for a particular condition. Heat 
treatment is one such process that commonly enhances the properties of steel.  The previous 
researchers have concentrated mainly on austempering and Martempering of AISI steels. 
However to t he best of authors’ knowledge no work has yet been conducted on the tempering 
of AISI 52100 alloy steel.  Thus the present research endeavor is one such attempt  to study 
the effect of heat treatment on the mechanical properties of AISI 52100 alloy steel. D ifferent 
tests like compression, hardness, impact and wear have been carried out after the tempering at 
250˚C, 350˚C, 450˚C and 550˚C respectively.  The tests are conducted as per ASTM 
standards.  It is observed that the as -received AISI samples possess high  carbide content 
which makes them hard, whereas the tempering reduces the carbide content indicating less 
hardness. The impact tests revealed that the impact strength of the tempered samples 
increased when compared to the as -received specimens. Moreover,  approximately 50 –60% 
wear resistance was improved with tempering of AISI steel . However,  the elasticity and 
Ductility values showed a decreasing -increasing trend which is typical of tool steels of this 
class. The applications of AISI 52100 steel include bearing manufacture, ball screws, and 
gauges. Based on the functional requirement, the choice can be made among the tempered 
AISI 52100 steels.  
 
Keywords : AISI steel, tempering, compression, hardness, impact, wear.  
 
1. INTRODUCTION  
 Steels can be subjected to  variety of conventional heat treatments like normalizing, 
hardening and tempering. Th e knowledge of materials and their properties is of great 
importance for a production engineer. The machine elements should be endowed with 
materials that possess propert ies suitable for withstanding different operating conditions.  For 
example, AISI 52100 is a high carbon alloy steel which achieves a high degree of hardness 
with compressive strength and abrasion resistance used in ball and roller bearings, spinning tools, punch and dies. In such cases, to bring about the required properties heat treatment 
methods are commonly used. The combined effect of heating and cooling operations 
performed in a metal or alloy in the solid state is termed as heat treatment. The high 
temperature austenite phase possesses a unique property to transform into diversified room 
temperature phases like coarse pearlite, martensite, and bainite depending upon cooling cycle 
[1-3]. These phases possibly are decomposition products like ferrite & cem entite or may be 
super saturated solid solutions. The factors such as plate thickness and interlammer spacing 
between ferrite and cementite phases in pearlite, greatly influence property and performance 
of steels. In case of the plate thickness and interla mmer spacing between ferrite and cementite 
being large; coarser will be the pearlite and ferrite, thereby increasing ductility. This is 
attainable by slow cooling of the austenitic phase to room temperature, accordingly the 
treatment is known as annealing [4-7].  If the austenitic phase is cooled at a slightly faster 
rate, the decomposition of austenite by the eutectoid reaction will be available to form finer 
pearlite with increase in weight percentage of eutectoid mixture (pearlite), this kind of 
treatmen t is known as normalizing [8 -11]. Here the degree of dispersion of ferrite and 
cementite in pearlite increases to improve the machinability with finer grain size. The 
normalized steel contains nearly 50 wt % of pearlite and 50 wt % of proeutectoid ferrite.  If 
the austenitic phase is cooled in such a way that the cooling rate is greater than or equal to 
critical cooling rate (CCR), the transformed phase is termed as martensite. It is supersaturated 
single phase with body centered tetragonal (BCT) structure. The BCT structure has got a c/a 
ratio higher with more trapped carbon in the lattice. Thus there is increase in hardness and 
strength with considerable amount of thermal stresses because of quenching severity. To 
decrease the c/a ratio of BCT martensite, t o improve toughness, to convert retained austenite 
into stable phases; to saturate the non -equilibrium BCT martensitic structure and to minimize 
the thermal stresses induced during hardening, tempering treatment is given. Depending upon 
the tempering tempe rature and duration, the improvement in toughness is achievable with the 
sacrifice of hardness and strength. Because of high brittleness, as quenched spring steels are 
seldom used for practical applications [12, 13]. By tempering process, the properties of  
quenched steel could be modified to improve its impact resistance. Amid tempering, the 
resulting microstructure contains bainite or epsilon carbide in a matrix of ferrite depending on 
the tempering temperature.   
Mandal et al. [12] investigated the in fluence of austempering on the mechanical 
properties and microstructure of silicon alloyed cast steel. The experimental results showed that, ausferrite structure consisting of bainitic ferrite and austenite could be retained by 
austempering the steel for dif ferent austempering temperature. MacIejewski and Regulski 
[13] conducted studies on the fracture assessment of martempered, quenched and tempered 
AISI 4140 low alloy steel. It was concluded that the  advantages of Martempering  include less 
distortion, elimi nation of cracking, improved fatigue, and improved impact energy. Lerner 
and Kingsbury [14] conducted dry sliding and abrasive wear experiments on Austempered 
Ductile Iron (ADI) in order to examine the potential applications of this material for wear 
parts , as an alternative to steels and other competitive materials. It was observed that ADI 
possessed excellent wear properties, combined with their relatively low -friction coefficient 
and could be potentially used for dry sliding wear applications. In abrasiv e wear mode, the 
wear rate of ADI was comparable to that of alloyed hardened AISI 4340 steel, and relatively 
one-half that of hardened medium carbon AISI 1050 steel. Jetley [15] reported improvement 
in tribological characters of aircra ft brake steel rotors  by Martempering. Martempering 
process was done by oil - and water -based quench ants at lower temperature. The samples 
were tested for hardness, distortion, and wear. The results showed that both hardness and 
wear resistances were lower when compared to the  austempering, and also met the design 
intent. However, to the best of the authors’ observations, there have been few reports on 
tempering behavior of AISI 52100. The objective of the present study is to investigate the 
effect of the tempering on the micro structure and mechanical properties of AISI 52100, 
providing reference for its various industrial applications.

given in the following Table 1.  
2.1 Test specimen preparation  
The material used for this study is AISI 52100 possessing a carbon content of about 1.10% 
carbon. The specimens were then prepared for a compression tests for finding out various 
parameters such as percentage reduction in length and Modulus of Elasticity using a standard 
format of ASTM. The tests were carried out by a Universal testing machine using prepared 
specimens.  
2.2 Heat treating the medium carbon steel  
Standard heat treatment procedures were adapted to heat treat the AISI stee l. Five different 
samples were prepared for each operation and the average values were calculated based on 
the analysis made . 2.3 Hardening Process  
The specimens to be hardened were placed inside the furnace and heated to a temperature of 
9000C. The samples we re retained at this temperature for a period of one hour (because of its 
mass) during which the transformation must have been completed. Hardening operation was 
carried out on five steel samples having the same dimensions.  
Table 1 - Chemical composition of AISI 52100 . 
 
2.3 Tempering Process   
Tempering consists of reheating of the quenched steel to a suitable temperature which is 
below the transformation temperature for a considerable amount of time and then cooling 
back to room temperature. This process permits microstructure modifications for reducing 
hardness to a desired level thereby increasing its ductili ty. Tempering results in a desired 
combination of ductility, hardness, toughness, strength and structural stability. The desired 
properties and structures depend on tempering temperature and time. Tempering of the 
quenched specimens was carried out in a mu ffle furnace for about one hour. Experimental 
heat treatment cycles for selective alloy is hardening and followed by tempering are done at 
2500C increased by 1000C to 5500C for each tempering time interval.  
 
2.4 Mechanical test  
After these treatments, mechanical properties of the specimens were examined i.e. hardness, 
compressive strength, Impact and wear test and percentage of elongation.  
 
2.6 Compression test specimen  
The compression test specimens were prepared as per ASTM C39 standards. A rectangul ar 
block of size 35×20×18.5mm was prepared for this purpose.  For tensile properties, standard 
tensile specimens were loaded into a 600 -kN universal testing machine  testing machine 
hooked up to a data logger. Load -elongation data were recorded and converted  into stress -
strain graphs. Material properties such as % reduction in length, Young’s Modulus (E) have 
been determined. The dimensions of the test specimen for compression are as shown in 
Figure 1.

Impact Toughness ( J) was recorded using the Izode  impact tester. A block of 75×10×10 mm 
is prepared.  For yielding the Izode impact testing machine, a V -notch angled 45 degrees at a 
distance of 27.5 mm  along the length of the specimen at a depth of 2.54 mm along its depth 
from the top end of the specime n is grooved. The detailed dimensions are as shown in Figure

2.9 Wear test specimen  
Abrasive wear of the specimens is measured using DUCOM abrasion tribometer according to 
ASTM G65 with application of 5 kg load at 200 rev/min. Dry sliding test is conducted on pin 
disc apparatus against EN32 steel disc having hardness of 470Hv to measure c oefficient of 
friction based on standard ASTM G99. The dimensions of the specimen are 6mm in diameter 
and 30mm in length.

2.10 Hardness test  
The hardness of specimens was measured with the aid of Rockwell method. The specimens 
were brought in  contact with the indenter .The hardness of a specimen is indicated by the 
penetration of the indenter on the said specimen  and displayed in dial of the ma chine. Indents 
were made on the polished surfaces using a 150kg load for HRC scale.  
 
3. Results and Discussions  
The resulting values are obtained from the hardness test and compression tests and plotted in 
the Figures 5 to 9 showing the range of tempering temperature and the variation of 
mechanical properties such as hardness and Modulus of Elasticity etc. The data generated 
from these graphs for each of the heat treated specimens were analyzed i.e. hardening at 
9000C and tempered at different tempering temperature 2500C to 5500C. The data clearly 
shows a decrease in hardness with increase in tempering temperature. V ariation of hardness 
against tempering temperature for each heat treatment sequence is shown in Figure 5. As 
tempering temperature increases, hardness then gradually decreases. It has been a general 
observation for steels that hardness decreases with highe r tempering temperatures. However, 
the increasing -decreasing trend seen here for AISI 52100 steel is in line with typical behavior 
of high -strength hot -work tool steels, especially H -category steels [16]. For all the cases the 
hardness values are quite clo se to each other, indicating that difference in heat treatment 
sequence does not have a significant effect on hardness.  The decrease in hardness is due to 
decrease in c/a ratio of martensite during tempering. The marginal decrease in hardness 
shows the ina dequate tempering duration which is 1 hour. This is due to the relaxation of the 
BCT martensitic cell i.e. the drastic reduction in c/a ratio of martensite. Figure 6 shows that 
with an increase in tempering temperature, impact toughness increases. The maxi mum value 
for impact toughness was observed at tempering temperature of 550 0C which construes the 
fact that high tempering  temperatures play a dominant role in behavior of impact toughness 
while compared to lower tempering temperatures. Th e average wear v olume loss of heat 
treated samples with respect to time in dry sliding test is presented in Figure 7. The bar graph 
clearly indicates that as the tempering temperature increases, the wear volume loss gradually 
decreases. The as-received specimen had consid erable amount of burr formation at the end 
which was kept on the tungsten disc. This indicates that a lot of heat was formed at the end 
which deformed the portion of that end plastically. Also this suggests that the material was 
more ductile than that of t he remaining samples.  Graphs portraying the variation of ductility 
(represented here as percent reduction) against tempering temperature for each heat treatment 
sequence are shown in Figure 8.  The Ductility suddenly increases as tempering temperature 
incre ases up to 2500C, and then starts to decrease rather sharply at 3500 C. This decreasing - 
increasing trend of ductility variation is typical of steels of this class. A huge difference exists 
between the ductility values for as -received and 2500C tempered specimen. Even though a 
huge difference is existing in these values for as -bought, tempered specimens, the fracture 
behavior of hardened specimen is totally different [17, 18]. This is the evidence for the 
formation of brittle supersaturated sol id solution of martensite. This also justifies that the as -
bought specimen is hot worked. This increase in ductility is due to the increase in weight % 
of pro -eutectoid ferrite which is coarse in size.  Figure 9 shows the variation of Modulus of 
elasticity (E) against tempering temperature. It is interesting to note that Elasticity first 
increases (for 2500C), then decreases (from 2500C to 3500C) and then gradually increase for higher tempering temperatures. Generally, a significant effect of heat treatment type on 
elasticity values is observed, where all the tempered specimens show a notable offset from 
each other.

Conclusions  
 
AISI 52100 steel was subjected to various heat treatments for enhancing the material 
properties. From the present study the following conclusions are drawn.  
• The as-received  AISI samples have high carbide content which makes them hard, 
whereas tempered samples reduce carbide content indicating less hardness.  
• Tempered samples have highest impact strength, the least being for as -received 
specimen . The impact  strength increased with  increase in tempering temperature  up to 
certain level  20%. 
• The tempered  samples lead to lowest  wear  volume loss , while as-received samples 
had the highest wear volume loss . Approximately 50 –60% wear resistance is 
increased with temperi ng process.  
• The Elasticity and  Ductility  values showed a decreasing -increasing trend which is 
typical of tool steels of this class . 
Based on functional requirement, the choice can be made among the tempered  AISI 52100 
steels.

Hot rolled dual phase steelAuto-temperingFibrous structureFractureThermo mechanical processingabstract
In this paper, the behavior of auto-tempering in hot rolled plain C-Mn dual phase steels was investigated.
The steels with thickness of 11 mm were fabricated on the compact strip production line and coiled at
150 °C and 260 °C, respectively. The auto-tempering in the steel with coiling temperature of 260 °C
caused the softening of ferrite and martensite and the reduction in hardness difference between these
two phases, ultimately led to the decrease in tensile strength and strain hardening ability and the in-
crease in post-necking elongation. The Charpy impact test results indicated that the toughness of auto-tempered steel was superior to the non-tempered steel. When the tensile test or impact test was con-ducted on the auto-tempered steel, both ferrite grains and tempered martensite islands were readily
elongated as ﬁbrous structure. The acquired ﬁbrous structure could inhibit the formation of microvoids
and propagation of cracks in tensile test, and delayed the tensile fracture. In addition, the ﬁbrous
structure could inhibit the propagation of main crack during impact test, whereas induced the branching
cracks, leading to high impact energy.

1. Introduction
There are two main approaches to improve the strength of
steels. The ﬁrst one is the addition of alloy elements, especially
microalloying elements; the second one is the improvement of
manufacture processes to expose the potential properties of steels.
The latter is more attractive due to the advantages of productive
resource usage and low-cost. Dual phase (DP) treatment is an
economical method to improve the mechanical properties ofsteels. The mechanical properties of DP steel, such as high tensile
strength, continuous yielding behavior, low yield strength and
high strain hardening rate and so on, are closely associated with
the transformation and morphology of martensite [1–4]. Because
tempering can change the morphology of martensite and other
structure characteristics derived from martensite transformation,
some of the mechanical properties of DP steel are sensitive to the
tempering process.
The microstructure evolution and changes in strength and
plasticity of heat treatment DP steel during tempering have been
fully investigated through the isothermal tempering treatment [5–
9]. Chang [5]summarized that the microstructure exhibiteddifferent characteristics under the four isothermal tempering re-
gimes: below 225 °C, 225 –350 °C, 350 –535 °C and above 535 °C,
respectively. Kuang [6]illustrated that the microstructure evolu-
tion of DP steel during tempering included three stages: the relief
of residual stress, the precipitation of carbides in both ferrite and
martensite, and the dissolution of carbides in the ferrite. At the
higher tempering temperature (above 300 °C), both tensile
strength and yield strength decreased, which was opposite to the
elongation. When the tempering temperature lowered than
200 °C, the changes in mechanical properties highly depended on
the tempering temperature and time. Except for tensile properties,
few studies focused on the effects of tempering on impact
toughness of DP steel. It is clear that the tempering of martensite
readily occurs in steels with lean chemical compositions, particu-
larly when the martensite forms near the martensite start tem-
perature ( M
s)[10,11]. Currently, the tempering of DP steels re-
ported in previous studies mainly stems from the reheating off-line, and few papers consider the tempering behavior occurred on
hot rolling line. In fact, the tempering process after coiling can
occur on the hot strip rolling line in the steels with thick gauge.
Because the residual heat is dif ﬁcult to transfer into surroundings,
the tempering occurs in the steel coils, called “auto-tempering ”.
Therefore, it is expected that the auto-tempering would occur in
the hot rolled plain C-Mn DP steel with thick gauge when the steel
are coiled at relative high temperature.Contents lists available at ScienceDirect

E-mail address: yuanguoneu@163.com (G. Yuan).Materials Science & Engineering A 665 (2016) 98 –107This work studies the phenomenon of auto-tempering on CSP
line in a hot rolled plain C-Mn DP steel with thickness of 11 mm.
The microstructure, tensile properties and impact properties were
investigated in the DP steels with the coiling temperature at
150 °C and 260 °C, respectively. The fracture behaviors during
tensile test and impact test were discussed in details to provide
fundamental understanding of the effects of auto-tempering on
strength, plasticity and toughness.
2. Experimental procedure
2.1. Thermo-mechanical controlled processing
The experimental steel was a plain C-Mn steel with a simple
chemical composition of 0.06 C, 0.45 Si, and 1.55 Mn (wt%),
without the addition of Ni, Cr and Mo (the measured amounts of
Ni, Cr and Mo were 0.009%, 0.02% and 0.005%, respectively). The
experiments were carried out on the CSP line of Baotou Steel in
China. The schematic diagram and the corresponding temperature
regime are given in Fig. 1 . The steels were casted into casting slabs
with gauge of 70 mm and then held for 12 min at 1180 °Ci na
tunnel furnace. The slabs were continuously hot-rolled into 11 mm
thick strips with the ﬁnish rolling temperature of 860 °C. After hot
rolling, the strips were immediately cooled to 670 °C by laminar
cooling system with the cooling rate of 30 °C/s, followed by air
cooling, then fast cooled to 150 °C and 260 °C respectively through
ultra fast cooling system with the cooling rate of 120 °C/s, and
eventually coiled into coils. After coiling, the coils were cooled in
the air. The cooling rate of the coils in the air decreased with time,
presented in Fig. 1 b. The air cooling process of coil from 260 °Ct o
150 °C took about 4 h, while that from 150 °C to room temperature
took about 35 h. For convenience, the steels strips with coilingtemperatures of 150 °C and 260 °C were abbreviated as CT1 and
CT2, respectively.
2.2. Microstructure observation and mechanical properties test
The steel coils were cooled in the air for 48 h before being
prepared into the specimens for metallography, tensile test and
V-notch Charpy impact. The metallography specimens were me-
chanically polished using standard metallographic procedure,
etched by 4% nital solution and observed using Leica-DMIRM op-
tical microscope (OM) and ZEISS ULTRA 55 ﬁeld emission scanning
electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. Additionally, the 3 mm
discs were punched and twin-jet electro polished in a mixture of
12.5% perchloric acid and 87.5% ethanol at /C030°C with a voltage
of 32 V. They were observed in a FEI Tecnai G
2F20ﬁeld-emission
transmission electron microscope (TEM) operated at 200 kV.
Micro-hardness measurements were carried out by FM-700
Vickers hardness testing machine with a load of 10 g. The tensile
samples with gauge length of 50 mm and diameter of 8 mm and
the V-notch Charpy impact specimens with the size of
10 mm /C210 mm /C255 mm were prepared along the rolling direc-
tion. CMT5105-SANS computerized tensile testing machine was
used to detect the tensile properties with a crosshead speed of
3 mm/min at room temperature. The Charpy impact test was im-
plemented at /C020 to/C0100 °C using Instron Dynatup 9200 series
instrumented drop weight impact tester.
3. Results
3.1. Microstructural characteristics at different coiling temperatures
Figs. 2 and, 3show the microstructures of the steels observedby OM, SEM and TEM. As shown in Figs. 2 a and 3a, the matrix of
the steels CT1 and CT2 consisted of /C2485% polygonal ferrite with
the average size of /C245.5mm. In the ferrite near the martensite/
ferrite interface, numerous dislocations were observed ( Figs. 2 b
and 3b), which were induced by martensite transformation and
affected the yielding behavior of dual phase steel [8]. The mar-
tensite morphology exhibited much difference between steels CT1
and CT2. Fig. 2 c and d shows that the surface of martensite islands
was smooth, suggesting no signi ﬁcant martensite tempering oc-
curred at coiling temperature of 150 °C. However, presented in
Fig. 3 c and d, ﬁne carbide particles were clearly observed in the
martensite islands and the interface of ferrite and martensite ex-
hibited less tetragonal, which inferred the martensite tempering at
coiling temperature of 260 °C. It is mentioned that there were also
few non-tempered martensites with small size in steel CT2
(Fig. 3 e). The possible reason is that these small-sized martensites
are highly enriched with carbon, forming at relative low tem-
perature and dif ﬁcult to be tempered.
It indicated that auto-tempering occurred in the plain C-Mn
dual phase steel when the coiling temperature was 260 °C. In the
dual phase steel, the Mswas calculated as follows [12]:

Mn were 0.06%, 0.45% and 1.55% respectively, and that of Ni, Cr and
Mo were ignored. The Msof untransformed austenite estimated
from (Eqs. (1) and 2)was/C24320 °C. Therefore, the martensite
transformation accompanied with auto-tempering would occur at
the coiling temperature of 260 °C, which was far more close to the
Msthan 150 °C. It was reported that the carbides formation during
tempering was suppressed by increasing the contents of Mn and Si
[13 –17]. However, the effect of Mn was weak when its content was
less than 2% [15]. To suppress cementite formation, the Si content

0.45% Si in the experimental steel may not play effectively role insuppressing carbide formation and increase the trends of auto-tempering.
Auto-tempering led to the softening of both ferrite and mar-
tensite. When the coiling temperature increased from 150 °Ct o
260 °C, the micro-hardness of ferrite decreased from 148 HV to
139 HV, and that of martensite dropped from 346 HV to 269 HV.
The softening degree of martensite was much larger than that offerrite, causing the reduction of hardness difference between thesetwo phases. This remarkable softening of martensite after auto-
tempering is associated with the migration of carbon atoms, pre-
cipitation of particles and recovery of dislocation structure and soon[18].
3.2. Mechanical properties at different coiling temperatures
3.2.1. Tensile properties
In the dual phase steel with low alloy, the auto-tempering is
readily occurred at the coiling temperature close to M
s, as men-
tioned above, which will alter the mechanical properties of the
steel. As shown in Fig. 4 , steel CT1 exhibited a continuous yielding
that was typical for dual phase steel. However, steel CT2 had ayield plateau with a pronounced increase in yield strength. It is
known that the continuous yielding of dual phase steel was mainly
attributed to the mobile dislocations produced by martensitetransformation at low temperature [1,7,19,20], for example in
Fig. 3 a. Dislocations, one of structure defects in crystalline solid
solutions, are disturbed regions with low thermodynamically
stability, and attract solute segregation when diffusion is enable[21 –23]. Therefore, when the coiling temperature increased to
260 °C, C and N atoms was considered to diffuse to the dislocations
and pinned them. Many researches had also demonstrated thatthe interstitial atoms of C and N could segregate and pin the dis-locations when the tempering temperature increased to /C24250 °C,
leading to the rise in yield strength and the appearance of yield
platform [7–9,19,23]. In this study, the yield plateau and the sig-
niﬁcantly increase in yield strength, to some extent, revealed that
interstitial atoms of C and N segregated and pinned the disloca-
tions during auto-tempering.
As listed in Table, 1 , steel CT1 was characterized by high tensile
strength and strong strain hardening ability, which attributed to
the high hardness of quenched martensite [24 –26]. For steel CT2,
the tensile strength decreased distinctly due to the softening ofmartensite. The reduction of hardness difference between ferriteand martensite caused by auto-tempering resulted in the decrease
of strain hardening ability [24,25]. When the coiling temperature
increased from 150 °C to 260 °C, the uniform elongation decreased
from 16.5% to 13%, which demonstrated that the auto-tempering
stimulated the occurrence of necking. It is known that the necking
appears when the strain hardening rate ( ds/d
ε) is equal or less
than the true stress ( s)[27], and the corresponding strain is the
uniform strain ( εu), shown in Fig. 5 . Thus, the increase of strain
hardening rate or the decrease of true stress can postpone the
occurrence of necking. After auto-tempering, both the strain
hardening rate and the true stress reduced, but the degree of the
former was more prominent. Therefore, the auto-tempering ac-
celerated the occurrence of necking. Nevertheless, the stress-strain
curve of steel CT2 had a distinct necking stage ( Fig. 4 ), and the
post-necking elongation and reduction of area reached 23.5% and
86%, respectively, higher than that of steel CT1. The data indicates
that steel CT2 has the high fracture resistance.
3.2.2. Charpy impact energy and fractograph of the specimens
Fig. 6 indicates that the toughness of steel CT2 was higher than
that of steel CT1. The impact energy ( vE) of steel CT1 was sensitive
to the test temperature and decreased from /C24185 J to /C2410 J with
the temperature decreasing from /C020°Ct o/C0100 °C. However,
the toughness of steel CT2 under the test temperature range of
/C020 to /C060 °C was such excellent (higher than 300 J) that the
specimens cannot be completely separated. When the tempera-
ture decreased from /C060 °Ct o/C0100 °C, the value of vEsharply
dropped to /C2415 J from /C24320 J.
The impact specimen macrofractographs of steel CT1 are given
inFig. 7 .A t/C020°C and /C040°C, the macrofractographs of steel
CT1 contained the typical ﬁbrous, radial, second ﬁbrous and shear
lip zones, marked by 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively in Fig. 7 a. The ﬁ-
brous, second ﬁbrous and shear lip zones of the steel CT1 at
/C020°C consisted of dimples ( Fig. 7 d–f), re ﬂecting the ductile
fracture. The dimples in ﬁbrous and second ﬁbrous zones were
stretched due to the shear stress. In the radial zone, the existence
of cleavage facets, tearing ridges and cracks indicated the brittle
fracture ( Fig. 7 g). As Shown in Fig. 7 b and c, with decrease in test

Fig. 5. True stress and strain hardening rate of the steels.C.-n. Li et al. / Materials Science & Engineering A 665 (2016) 98 –107 101temperature, the area of ﬁbrous, second ﬁbrous and shear lip
zones decreased, replaced by the radial zone. At /C060°C, the radial
zone occupied almost all the fracture surface of specimens.
For steel CT2, shown in Fig. 8 a, d and e, the fracture surfaces of
unseparated specimen tested at /C060°C consisted of dimples, and
the branching cracks were observed in the fracture surface. The
macrofractures of steel CT2 at /C080°C(Fig. 8 b) were familiar to
that of steel CT1 at /C020°C and /C040°C. However, Fig. 8 f–h shows
that the dimples of steel CT2 were larger than that of steel CT1,
indicating the superior toughness. At /C0100 °C, the fracture surface
of specimens were mainly comprised of radial zone, which proven
the low toughness at this temperature.
Assuming that the test temperature corresponding to where
the area of radial zone occupies 50% of the fracture surface is the
ductile-to-brittle transition temperature (DBTT), the DBTT reduced
to/C2480°C from /C2440°C when the steel was auto-tempered. The
transition of ductile-to-brittle attributed to the competition of
plastic deformation and brittle fracture at the tips of cracks or
defects, and the DBTT was determined by the difference between
tensile stress near the crack tips and the brittle fracture stress [28 –
30]. According to Yoffee diagram [28,29], when the effective yield
stress, at which signi ﬁcant deformation occurs, exceeds the brittle
fracture stress, the brittle fracture occurs. Although the yieldstrength of steel CT2 was higher than that of steel CT1 during
tensile test, the stress of steel CT2 was lower than steel CT1 when
the strain exceeds 0.01, shown in Fig. 4 , which resulted from the
softening of ferrite and martensite. In addition, the softening of
steel CT2 caused by auto-tempering led to the extensive plastic
deformation before fracture. It was clear that the extensive plastic
deformation at the crack tip limited the local stress and inhibited
the brittle fracture [31]. Therefore, the auto-tempering played an
effective role in delaying the transition of ductile-to-brittle.
4. Discussion
4.1. Effects of auto-tempering on tensile fracture behavior
Fig. 9 indicates that both the two steels fractured under ductile
mechanism with cup-and-cone fracture. The steels suffered an
obvious plastic deformation before fracture. However, the degree
of section contraction of steel CT2 was much larger than that of
steel CT1, indicating that auto-tempering provided superior duc-
tility for DP steel. The fracture surfaces included two parts: centralﬁber zone and surrounding shear lip, marked in Fig. 9 . During the
tensile test, the microvoids virtually begin to initiate before

niﬁcantly increases and then induces more microvoids. The coa-
lescence of microvoids leads to the microcracks, which grow per-
pendicular to the applied stress and evolve into the central ﬁber
zone. As the necking further continues, the crack propagates along
the 45 °maximum shear stress direction and develops into the
shear lip [28,32]. The shear lip of steel CT2 exhibited ring-like with
“Λ”shape, which was caused by the severe deformation before
fracture. As shown in the micrographs at high magni ﬁcation, the
fracture surfaces of the steels were composed of dimples. Never-
theless, the dimples in the ﬁber zone of steel CT2 were much
larger and deeper than that of steel CT1, which may be the reason
the post-necking elongation of steel CT2 was much larger than
that of steel CT1.
Fig. 10 shows the micrographs at subsurface under the main
fracture surface of tensile specimens. The ferrite grains and mar-
tensite islands were elongated in the necking zone of steel CT1, but
the elongated extent of ferrite grains was much higher than that of
martensite islands due to the large hardness difference between
ferrite and non-tempered martensite. The deformation in-
compatibility between ferrite and martensite resulted in high
stress concentration, especially where the shape of martensite was
tetragonal and sharp. Since the deformation between ferrite and
martensite was highly incompatible ( Fig. 10 a) and the pure mar-
tensites were tetragonal ( Fig. 2 c) in steel CT1, lots of microvoids
initiated around the tips of the elongated martensite islands (in-
dicated by arrows in Fig. 10 a), which led to the relatively small
post-necking elongation.
For steel CT2, both ferrite grains and tempered martensite is-
lands were severely elongated as ﬁbrous structure. The larger
deformation and the better deformation compatibility between
ferrite and tempered martensite were due to the softening and
reduction of hardness difference between these two phases.Fig. 10 b indicates that the microvoids in steel CT2 tended to in-
itiate near the non-tempered martensite islands and inclusions
because the deformations of ferrite matrix and non-tempered
martensite (or inclusion) were still incompatibility. Since most of
martensite islands were auto-tempered and became less tetra-
gonal ( Fig. 3 c) and the ferrite and martensite compatibly deformed
asﬁbrous structure, the stress concentration was small compared
to steel CT1. Therefore, the nucleation sites of microvoids in steel
CT2 (indicated by arrows in Fig. 10 b) was far less than that in steel
CT1. The fewer nucleation sites of microvoids could explain why
the dimples in fracture surface of steel CT2 were much larger and
deeper than steel CT1. Additionally, the cracks in steel CT2 were
expected to propagate more dif ﬁcult to across the section of ten-
sile specimen due to the ﬁbrous structure normal to the propa-
gation direction of cracks. Although both of two steels fractured
with ductile mechanism, steel CT2 exhibited the higher ability to
prevent the crack formation and propagation.
4.2. Effects of auto-tempering on impact fracture behavior
To investigate the fracture process and the fracture behavior of
the steels at different temperatures, the impact load ( P), impact
energy and de ﬂection ( u) were recorded by instrument during
impact test. Fig. 11 a and b show that the P-ucurves of steel CT1 at
/C020°C and /C040°C had the similar shape. At the beginning, the
impact load increased rapidly to the peak value Pm. In this stage,
the elastic deformation and plastic deformation occurred succes-
sively, and the absorbed energy corresponding to the Pmwas crack
initiate energy ( vEi). The value of vEiat/C020°C and /C040°C were
stable at 40 –45 J in steel CT1. Then, with the increase in u, the
value of Pslowly decreased to Py, then dropped to Paand slowly
reduced to zero ( P0), successively. The stages of PmPy,PyPaand PaP0
reﬂected the processes of ductile propagation, brittle fracture and
Fig. 10. Subsurfaces of the main fracture surface in tensile specimens for steels CT1 (a) and CT2 (b).C.-n. Li et al. / Materials Science & Engineering A 665 (2016) 98 –107 104ductile fracture, respectively. The total absorbed energy of these
three stages was crack propagation energy ( vEp). When the test
temperature declined from /C020°Ct o/C040°C in steel CT1, the
value of vEpdecreased from /C24139 J to /C2495 J. This suggested that
the lower temperature accelerated the crack propagation and
eventually deteriorates the toughness.
The microvoids and cracks underneath the fracture surface of
specimen at /C020°C for steel CT1 are presented in Fig. 12 a and b.
Microvoids were observed underneath the ﬁbrous zone of fracture
surface, implying the ductile fracture. Underneath the radial zone,
the cracks exhibited transgranular with the brittle mechanism. The
characteristics of P-ucurves and the observation of cracks under-
neath the fracture surface in steel CT1 demonstrated the mixedmechanism of ductile and brittle in the range of /C020 to/C040°C. In
theP-ucurves at /C060 to /C0100 °C, the ductile propagation and
ductile fracture stages disappeared ( Fig. 11 c–e), which suggests
that the fracture mechanism converted from mixture of ductileand brittle fracture to complete brittle fracture.
InFig. 11 a–c, the P-ucurves of steel CT2 at /C020 to /C060°C
exhibited a distinct ductile propagation stage. It indicated that the
auto-tempering played an effective role in suppressing the pro-
pagation of cracks. With increase in u,Pdecreased slowly from P
m,
then rapidly declined to the ﬁrst plateau stage, and the second
plateau stage, and ﬁnally dropped to zero when the specimen was
struck away from the specimen holder. This similar plateau-step of
P-ucurve was also observed in the low-carbon steel with severe
elongated structure, multilayer composite steel and glass- ﬁber/
vinyl-ester composite [29,33,34]. In these materials, the branching
cracks tended to propagate along the interfaces of elongated
structure or ﬁber planes that were normal to the propagation di-
rection of the main crack. In this case, the propagation of the main
cracks was restrained, resulting in the plateau stage of P-ucurve.
The impact load dropped when the new cracks initiated. In the
fractographs ( Fig. 8 a, d and e) and micrographs underneath the
Fig. 11. Typical curves of impact load and impact energy versus de ﬂection at different temperatures (black lines-steel CT1, red lines –steel CT2, solid lines - impact load and
dashed lines - impact energy): (a) /C020°C, (b)/C040°C, (c)/C060°C (d)/C080°C and (e) /C0100 °C. (For interpretation of the references to color in this ﬁgure legend, the reader is
referred to the web version of this article.)C.-n. Li et al. / Materials Science & Engineering A 665 (2016) 98 –107 105fracture surface ( Fig. 12 b and c) of the impact specimens, the
branching cracks were observed clearly in steel CT2 at /C020°C and
/C060°C. The branching cracks were attributed to the acquired ﬁ-
brous structure. Presented in Fig. 12 b and c, the branching cracks
propagated along the interface of ﬁbrous structure.
The shape of P-ucurve of steel CT2 at /C080°C(Fig. 11 d) was
similar to that of steel CT1 at /C020 to/C040°C, showing the similar
fracture mechanism. In Fig. 12 e and f, similar to micrographs of
steel CT1 at /C020°C(Fig. 12 a and b), the microvoids and the
transgranular cracks were observed in ﬁbrous and radial zones,
respectively. At /C0100 °C, the P-ucurve of steel CT2 exhibited the
brittle type. Consequently, with the decrease in test temperature
from/C020°Ct o/C0100 °C, the fracture mechanism of steel CT2
transferred from ductile fracture accompanied with branching
crack to mixture of ductile and brittle fracture, and ﬁnally to brittle
fracture.
5. Conclusions
1. The microstructure consisted of polygonal ferrite and non-tempered martensite islands in the hot rolled plain C-Mn DP
steel coiled at 150 °C. When the coiling temperature was 260 °C,
the interface of ferrite and martensite became less tetragonal,
and the ﬁne carbide particles dispersed in the martensite is-
lands were also observed. Both of them re ﬂected the occurrence
of auto-tempering, leading to the softening of ferrite and mar-
tensite and the reduction of hardness difference between these
two phases.
2. The auto-tempering resulted in the appearance of yield plat-
form with the increase in yield strength, while both the strain
hardening rate and the tensile strength decreased. In particular,
the auto-tempered DP steel exhibited a distinct necking stage,
implying the superior ductility. During tensile test, the ferrite
grains and tempered martensite islands were severely elon-
gated as ﬁbrous structure, which effectively postponed the
tensile fracture.
3. Compared with the non-tempered steel, the auto-tempered DP
steel had higher impact energy and lower DBTT. When the test
temperature decreased from /C020 to /C060°C, the fracture me-
chanism of non-tempering DP steel converted from mixture of
ductile and brittle fracture to complete brittle fracture. At the
test temperature above /C060°C, the impact specimens of auto-

Bimodal grain structureMechanical propertiesABSTRACT
In the present research, the AISI 321 austenitic stainless steel was subjected to cold rolling with di ﬀerent amount
of reductions. The 80% cold rolled samples were then annealed in the temperature range of 700 –900 °C with
diﬀerent durations. The microstructural evolutions during cold rolling and subsequent annealing were in-
vestigated by XRD analysis, optical and scanning electron microscopy, and feritscope analysis. The mechanical
properties were evaluated by room temperature tensile testing. Results showed that the amount of strain inducedmartensite is increased with increasing the rolling reduction. Annealing at 700 °C for 2 min resulted in the
simultaneous increase of tensile strength and elongation due to the formation of ultra ﬁne grain austenite. By
annealing at 900 °C for 5, 10, and 15 min the bimodal grain structure was obtained as a result of the occurrence
of static recrystallization and martensite to austenite reverse transformation simultaneously. Results of tensile
testing showed that the good combination of strength and elongation is obtained by the formation of bimodal
grain structure.
1. Introduction
Austenitic stainless steels are used in a wide range of applications
due to their several desirable characteristics such as the combination of
the resistance to oxidation at high temperatures as a result of the for-
mation of passive chromium oxide (Cr 2O3)ﬁlm on the surface [1], and
the creep resistance [2,3] , which makes them suitable for high tem-
perature applications. For example, austenitic stainless steels are suc-
cessfully used in the power generation industry at temperatures above
650 °C and remain in service for more than 100,000 h [4]. Although,
austenitic stainless steels have a good corrosion resistance [5]and
formability [6]but their yield strength is relatively low. For example,
the 0.2% o ﬀset yield strength of coarse grained AISI 316 austenitic
stainless steel is around 250 MPa at ambient temperature [7]. There-
fore, increasing the strength of stainless steels seems necessary to ex-tend their application toward heavier loading conditions. In this regard,
one of the ways to improve the strength of austenitic stainless steels is
the addition of alloying elements such as nitrogen which increases
tensile and yield strength with the expense of their ductility and
formability [8]. Another e ﬀective way is the grain re ﬁnement which
increases the strength and toughness without impairing ductility[9,10] . The commonly used techniques for grain re ﬁnement are based
on two di ﬀerent approaches: severe plastic deformation (SPD) [11] andadvanced thermomechanical processing (ATMP) [12]. During severe
plastic deformation, a very high levels of plastic strain is imposed on
sample through repetitive processing and the grain re ﬁnement is
achieved by the mechanism similar to continuous dynamic re-crystallization where the grain boundaries are developed from dis-
location cells as a result of the extended recovery and increase of the
misorientation angle with continued straining [13]. The main draw-
backs of SPD techniques are the batch nature of these processes and alsothe small dimensions of processed samples which make them suitable
for the synthesis of the laboratory scale samples instead of the industrial
scale production of ultra ﬁne grained and nanostructured steels. In
contrast with SPD processing, the advanced thermomechanical pro-cesses can be performed in industrial scale to produce ultra ﬁne grained
steels products such as sheets and strips. For plain carbon and micro-alloyed steels the advanced thermomechanical processes are based on
diﬀerent approaches such as strain induced austenite to ferrite trans-
formation [14], rolling in the inter critical temperatures range [15,16] ,
cold rolling and annealing of martensitic steels [17]. In the case of
austenitic stainless steels, the austenite phase is stable at ambienttemperature and austenite to ferrite transformation which is the base of
thermomechanical processing of plain carbon steels does not occur
during cooling. The new thermomechanical treatment for austenitic
stainless steel is the heavy cold deformation which is followed by

Tannealing [18,19] . In this process the austenite phase is transformed to
metastable martensite during cold deformation and the ultra ﬁne
grained microstructure is obtained through the martensite to austenite
reversion annealing [20]. The cold rolling and reversion annealing
process has been successfully performed on di ﬀerent types of austenitic
stainless steels such as AISI 201 [21], AISI 301 [22], AISI 304 [23,24]
steels and the pronounced grain re ﬁnement was observed. Careful in-
spection of literature shows that the response of the Ti stabilized aus-
tenitic stainless steel (AISI 321) to the cold working and reversion an-
nealing process has not been studied yet. Therefore, in the present
investigation, the AISI 321 austenitic stainless steel was subjected to
cold rolling with 80% reduction and the formation of strain induced
martensite was studied using optical microscopy and x-ray di ﬀraction
analysis. Also, obtained ultra- ﬁne grained microstructure after rever-
sion annealing was characterized and its impact on mechanical prop-
erties was evaluated using tensile testing.
2. Material and experimental procedure
In the present investigation, the AISI 321 austenitic stainless steel
was used in the form of a sheet with a thickness of 10 mm. The chemical
composition of the investigated steel is shown in Table 1. The sheet was
cut into smaller pieces with dimensions of 150 × 25 mm to be suitablefor cold rolling. All pieces were solution annealed at 1200 °C for 15 min
and then quenched in water to obtain a fully austenitic structure. The
cold rolling was then applied at room temperature with a thickness
reduction of 10%, 30%, 60%, 80%, and 90%. After a few passes, the
pieces were cooled in water to prevent temperature rise during rolling.
Cold rolled samples were then cut to be used for metallography, tensile
testing and further processing with reversion annealing according to the
procedure shown in Fig. 1. The reversion annealing was performed in
the temperature range of 700– 900 °C for di ﬀerent durations (2, 5, 10,
15, and 25 min). Samples were quenched in water after the speci ﬁed
annealing times. The microstructures of annealed samples were in-
vestigated using optical microscopy. The common metallographic pro-
cedure was used for preparation of samples for optical microscopy
analysis. For this reason, the sample surfaces were ground using silicon
carbide papers from 100 to 2500 grit and then mechanically polished
using 0.05 µm alumina suspension. The electrolytic etching in the so-
lution of 50% nitric acid and distilled water, by applying the current
density of 0.1 mA/cm
2, was used to reveal the grain structure. Optical
micrographs were obtained using Olympus PMG3 microscope. X-raydiﬀraction analysis was performed for identi ﬁcation of di ﬀerent phases
in the cold rolled samples. For this reason, the Bruker Advanced D8diﬀractometer was used with the step size of 0.1 and step time of 1 s. A
XL30 scanning electron microscope equipped with EDS was used toidentify the chemical composition of inclusion.
Also, the volume fraction of martensite phase at cold rolled samples
was determined using Fischer FMP30 feritscope. The mechanical
properties of samples annealed at di ﬀerent temperatures and durations
was evaluated by tensile testing at room temperature. Tensile sampleswere prepared according to the ASTM E8 standard. Tensile tests were
conducted using Gotech AI-7000-LA20 testing machine with the cross
head speed of 0.1 mm/min and the average of two tests was used for
determination of tensile strength and elongation to failure of each
sample.3. Results and discussion
3.1. Microstructural evolution during initial annealing
Fig. 2(a) represents the optical micrograph of AISI 321 austenitic
stainless steel before etching. The TiN inclusions are easily dis-
tinguished as yellow color particles distributed uniformly in the matrix.
Fig. 2(b) shows the microstructure of AISI 321 steel after annealing at
1200 °C for 15 min. As can be seen, the microstructure is composed of
austenite phase with mean grain size about 200 µm. Also, some an-
nealing twins are observable inside austenite grains in conjunction with
TiN inclusions. For further con ﬁrmation, the X-ray di ﬀraction analysis
was performed on annealed steel. The di ﬀraction pattern of as annealed
AISI 321 steel is shown in Fig. 2 (c). It is obvious that only the austenite
peaks are distinguished in the peak pro ﬁle of the annealed material.
Therefore, the results con ﬁrmed that only austenite phase exists in the
annealed microstructure.
3.2. Microstructural evolution during cold rolling
It is well known that the cross slip of dislocations in face centered
cubic (FCC) materials become di ﬃcult with decreasing stacking fault
energy [25]. Austenitic stainless steels are among the low stacking fault
energy materials and their microstructures are prone to dynamic re-
crystallization when deforming at high temperatures [26]. Also, the low
temperature deformation of austenitic stainless steels such as coldrolling is accompanied by the formation of deformation induced twins
and subsequent austenite to martensite transformation [27]. In this
class of materials, mechanical twins are formed as a result of the suc-cessive accumulation of stacking faults on the {111} slip planes. But,
the εmartensite is formed due to the alternative pile up of stacking
faults. The stacking fault energy (SFE) of austenitic stainless steels canbe evaluated using the following expression [28]:
⎛
⎝⎞⎠=− + − − + SFEmJ
mCr Ni Mn Mo 53 0.7(% ) 6.2(% ) 3.2(% ) 9.3(% )
2
According to the above equation, the SFE of the investigated aus-
tenitic stainless steel is calculated to be 22 mJ/m2. If the SFE of aus-
tenitic stainless steel is higher than 20 mJ/m2, the εmartensite is not
formed during cold deformation. In this case, intersected mechanical
twins are formed at lower strains and the άmartensite is developed at
higher imposed strains mainly in the intersected regions of twinboundaries. In contrast, when the SFE is lower than 20 mJ/m
2, the ε
martensite is formed at initial stage of cold deformation and the ά
martensite is developed with further straining [28]. It is concluded that
the εmartensite is not formed during deformation of the investigated
steel because the SFE value is higher than 20 mJ/m2.Fig. 3 shows the
microstructure of AISI 321 steel after cold rolling with 80% reduction.
In this optical micrograph the dark regions contain shear bands,Table 1

365mechanical twins and άmartensite phase and the bright regions are
deformed austenite with lower values of plastic deformation. It was
well established that the microstructure of heavily cold worked metals
is in the ﬁbrous form. This type of microstructure is consisted of in-
termittent layers of severely deformed and somewhat low strainedmaterial [29]. For evaluation of the e ﬀect of plastic strain on the
amount of strain induced martensite phase, the AISI 321 austeniticstainless steel was subjected to di ﬀerent rolling reductions and the X-
ray di ﬀraction patterns were compared with that of as annealed ma-
terial. Fig. 4 shows the XRD patterns of as annealed and cold deformed
AISI 321 steel after 30%, 60% and 80% rolling reductions. It can beseen, that the annealed materials doesn ’t exhibit any peaks of the BCClattice structure (martensite phase). However after 30% rolling reduc-tion, the martensite peaks are appeared in the X-ray di ﬀraction pattern
but the austenite peaks are still presents with higher intensities whichdemonstrates that the austenite to martensite transformation was in-
itiated but the higher fraction of microstructure is composed of auste-
nite phase. Unlike 30% cold rolled steel, the peak intensities of the
austenite phase after 60% cold rolling is much less than martensite
phase, which indicates the progress of the transformation of deforma-
tion induced austenite to martensite phase. Also, after 80% cold rolling
the peak intensities of the austenite phase are very weak or the peaks
are disappeared. The feritscope was used for determination of the
martensite contents of the cold rolled steel. It must be mentioned that
the feritscope device measures the ferrite or martensite content in the
microstructure of dual phase steels according to the magnetic induction
method. In this method, a magnetic ﬁeld generated by a coil enters into
interaction with the magnetic components of the specimen. Thechanges in the magnetic ﬁeld induce a voltage proportional to the
ferrite content in a second coil. Fig. 5 shows the variations of martensite
content with the amount of the reduction during cold rolling. As it is
clear the amount of strain induced martensite is increased with rolling
reduction and comprises about the 50% of microstructure after 90%
cold rolling. It is worth noting that the martensite phase in austenitic
stainless steels is developed in the interesting regions of shear bands
and deformation twins. The number of intersecting regions is increased
with increasing the amount of cold working and consequently the vo-lume fraction of martensite phase is increased.
3.3. Microstructural evolution during post deformation annealing
As mentioned before, the nature of inclusions that are scattered in a
microstructure, with a square or triangular morphology, cannot be

reduction.H.A. Rezaei et al. Materials Science & Engineering A 736 (2018) 364–374
366distinguished using the x-ray di ﬀraction pattern due to their very small
volume fraction. Fig. 6 represents the SEM micrograph along with EDS
analysis from the scattered inclusions in the austenite matrix. As it is
clear, these inclusions contain titanium and nitrogen elements that
match with the composition of TiN intermetallic phase. The optical
micrographs from the microstructure of AISI 321 austenitic stainlesssteel after annealing at 700 C for di ﬀerent durations are shown in Fig. 7.
In all microstructures, the dark regions indicate the martensite phase or
the ultra- ﬁne grained austenite transformed from strain induced mar-
tensite during annealing, and the bright regions are the elongatedaustenite grains exist in the microstructure of samples after cold rolling.
It is worth noting that static recovery is occurred inside these elongated

state.H.A. Rezaei et al. Materials Science & Engineering A 736 (2018) 364–374
367grains during annealing. Some shear bands are also observed in Fig. 7 as
indicated by arrows. In addition, the dark regions in Fig. 7 are heavily
deformed austenite which was transformed to άmartensite during de-
formation, and the ultra ﬁne grained austenite formed from martensite
phase during annealing. Therefore, some regions with ultra ﬁne grained
austenite phase are formed in the microstructure after annealing at
700 ̊C. Also, it is seen that the volume fraction of ultra ﬁne grained
austenite is increased with increasing annealing time from 2 to 25 min.It is observed that after annealing for 25 min at 700 °C, near the 70% of
microstructure is transformed to ultra ﬁne grained austenite. Also, shear
bands inside the elongated austenite grains were disappeared due to theannealing e ﬀect (see Fig. 7(d)). It is worth noting that the annealing
temperature of 700 ̊°C is not higher enough to trigger static re-
crystallization inside cold rolled austenite (bright regions in Fig. 7)
during annealing so that the elongated austenite grains are observed inall of the annealed microstructures.
Fig. 8 represents the optical microstructures of AISI 321 austenitic
stainless steel after cold rolling and annealing at 900 ̊C for di ﬀerent
durations. As can be seen, after annealing for 2 min at 900 °C ( Fig. 8(a)),
the microstructure is composed of austenite grains elongated in the
rolling directions with shear bands aligned parallel to each other andultraﬁne austenite grains developed in some regions between two
neighboring elongated grains. After 5 min annealing ( Fig. 8(b)), some
equiaxed grains are observed inside elongated austenite grains in con-
junction with the ultra ﬁne grains developed as a consequence of the
reversion of strain induced martensite to austenite phase. It is alsoworth to note that the static recrystallization of cold worked austenite
grains is not complete after annealing for 5 min and the boundaries
between elongated grains are observable indicating the cold worked
features. In Fig. 8 (c), the microstructure after 10 min annealing at900 °C, it is seen that the fraction and the size of recrystallized grains
inside primary austenite grains (cold worked grains) is increased
compared with the microstructure of annealed sample for 5 min. It is
also apparent that the mean grain size of the ultra ﬁne austenite grains
developed as a result of the martensite to austenite inverse transfor-mation is increased with increasing the annealing time to 10 min. As
seen in Fig. 8(c), the bimodal grain structure is developed after an-
nealing at 900 °C for 10 min which is consisted of the intermittent layersof recrystallized grains and ﬁner grains developed as a result of the
martensite to austenite reversion. Increasing annealing time to 15 min(Fig. 8(d)) results in the growth of the two types of austenite grains but
the traces of the elongated primary austenite grains are remained due tothe limited growth of the recrystallized and reversion transformed
austenite grains. Whereas, the uniform microstructure with equiaxed
austenite grains are developed after annealing for 25 min at 900 °C and
the traces of the primary elongated austenite grains are disappeared
(Fig. 8 (e)). As can be seen, the bimodal grain structure is replaced with
uniform grain structure after prolonged annealing due to the highergrowth rate of the ultra ﬁne austenite grains compared with statically
recrystallized grains. Therefore, the di ﬀerence between the grain sizes
of these two types of austenite grains is decreased with increasing the
annealing duration and ﬁnally the uniform grain structure is obtained.
It is worth to note that the high amounts of Ti is added to AISI 321austenitic stainless steel to prevent grain boundary sensitization at high
temperatures. This amounts of Ti (for example 0.32% wt. in the in-
vestigated steel) is high enough to form di ﬀerent
 types of precipitates
and inclusions. It is well stablished that the TiN inclusions are formed
during solidi ﬁcation process and remain stable upon cooling to ambient
temperature [29]. This type of inclusions are in the size of several
micrometer and distributed uniformly in the austenite matrix. Also, it
has been demonstrated that the nanometer sized TiC and Ti(C, N)
precipitates are formed in the matrix of Ti modi ﬁed steels [30].
Therefore, the interaction of nanometer sized precipitates with auste-
nite grain boundaries decreases the boundary mobility and hinder the
growth of austenite grains. Also, the coarse TiN inclusions provides
preferred nucleation sites for static recrystallization during annealing
which is called particle stimulated nucleation (PSN) [31]. Accordingly,
the both mentioned mechanisms result in higher levels of grain re-ﬁnement in AISI 321 steel compared with other grades of austenitic
stainless steels.
Fig. 9 shows the optical microstructures of cold rolled AISI 321
austenitic stainless steel after annealing for 25 min at di ﬀerent tem-
peratures. As mentioned, at annealing temperature of 700 °C the com-
bination of ultra ﬁne and primary elongated austenite grains are ob-
served after 25 min annealing ( Fig. 9(a)). Increasing annealing
temperature to 750 °C, results in the growth of reverted austenite
grains. Careful inspection of Fig. 9 (b) reveals that the shear bands are

368observable inside some elongated grains. It is concluded that the static
recrystallization is not initiated at this temperature. At annealing
temperature of 800 °C ( Fig. 9 (c)) the size of the reverted austenite
grains is increased and shear bands are disappeared which is the in-
dication of the occurrence of recrystallization. After annealing at 850 °C
(Fig. 9(d)) the bimodal grain structure is obtained as a result of the
martensite to austenite reversion and static recrystallization in elon-gated grains. Finally, the uniform grain structure is obtained as a result
of the austenite grain growth ( Fig. 9(e)).3.4. Mechanical properties
Fig. 10 represents the engineering stress - engineering strain curves
of initial annealed (d~ 200 µm) and cold rolled steel. As can be seen,the AISI 321 steel in the annealed condition has lower strength and
higher elongation to failure compared with cold worked condition.
Elongation to failure of annealed steel is around 125% which decreases
to 14.7% after 80% cold rolling reduction. Also, the tensile strength is
increased from 440 MPa to 1270 MPa by cold rolling. The increase in
the tensile strength value and the reduction of the elongation to failure
of austenitic stainless steels with cold rolling can be attributed to the
increased dislocation density, formation of substructures and the

369presence of deformation induced martensite. In the present investiga-
tion, the e ﬀect of post annealing treatment on mechanical properties of
the AISI 321 austenitic stainless steel were evaluated using a series oftensile testing at room temperature. Fig. 11 shows the engineering
stress-strain curves of material after annealing at 700 °C and 900 °C fordiﬀerent durations. Also the e ﬀect of annealing duration on tensile
strength and elongation of cold rolled steel is represented in Fig. 12 .A s
it is evident, both of tensile strength and elongation to failure of sam-
ples annealed for 2 min at 700 °C is higher than the cold rolled sample.
The increase in the tensile strength with annealing can be described
according to the microstructural evolutions. It must be mentioned that
during annealing for 2 min the strength of material is a ﬀected with twoimportant microstructural phenomena. The ﬁrst one is the occurrence
of recovery inside the deformed austenite grains and the second is the
formations of reverted ultra ﬁne grained austenite from strain induce
martensie in the area of primary austenite grain boundaries. In theinitial stages of annealing the degree of the increase in strength due to
the formation of ultra ﬁne grain (UFG) austenite is higher than the
amount of softening due to the recovery inside the primary austenitegrains. Therefore, the tensile strength is increased with annealing.
Further annealing results in the higher degree of recovery with the
annihilation and rearrangement of dislocations inside the elongated
grains and also the growth of UFG austenite grains developed at the
early stages of annealing. Therefore it is observed that the tensile

e) 25 min.H.A. Rezaei et al. Materials Science & Engineering A 736 (2018) 364–374
370strength is decreased with increasing annealing time. Also, it is ap-
parent that the elongation is almost constant at annealed samples. The
insigni ﬁcant variations of elongation with annealing time are a con-
sequence of the microstructural evolutions. The occurrence of staticrecovery inside deformed austenite increases the amount of elongation
to failure but its e ﬀect is compensated by the decrease in elongation due
to the formation of ultra ﬁne grained austenite. As can be seen in Fig. 7
the volume fraction of reverted austenite is increased with annealing
time and its inverse e ﬀect on elongation is compensated by the progress
of recovery in primary elongated austenite grains. Fig. 11 (b) shows the
stress-strain curves of cold rolled steel after annealing at 900 °C for
diﬀerent durations. Also, the e ﬀect of annealing time on tensile strengthand elongation of cold rolled AISI 321 steel is shown in Fig. 12 (b). As it
is seen, the tensile strength is decreased with annealing duration and
the elongation to failure is increase and reaches to the steady state
value. The variations in the mechanical properties can be explained
considering the microstructural evolutions during annealing at 900 °C.
As it is obvious in Fig. 8, the static recrystallization is occurred inside
primary cold worked austenite grains and the reverted austenite grainsformed from strain induced martensite grow during annealing. As it is
seen, the di ﬀerence between the grain size of recrystallized and re-
verted austenite grain is decreased with increasing annealing time andthe bimodal structure formed in the initial stages of annealing changes
into uniform microstructure after annealing for 25 min ( Fig. 8 (e)).
Fig. 9. Optical microstructures of col rolled AISI 321 austenitic stainless steel annealed for 25 min at di ﬀerent temperatures: a) 700 °C, b) 750 °C, c) 800 °C, d) 850 °C,
and e) 900 °C.H.A. Rezaei et al. Materials Science & Engineering A 736 (2018) 364–374
371Therefore, during short time annealing the partial recrystallization is
occurred ( Fig. 8(a)) and the reverted austenite grains doesn ’t grow
signiﬁcantly. Accordingly, the tensile strength is higher and the elon-
gation to failure is lower compared with other samples. With increasing
annealing time the volume fraction of recrystallized austenite is in-
creased and the ultra ﬁne grained austenite grains grow so that the
tensile strength is decreased and the elongation is increased. It is im-
portant to mention that the elongation is almost constant in samplesannealed for 5– 15 min. Inspection of the resultant microstructures in
Fig. 8 reveals that the bimodal microstructure is developed at these
annealing conditions. Therefore, the elongation to failure is a ﬀected by
the size and volume fraction of these two types of austenite grains.
Finer austenite grains are developed as a result of the reversion of strain
induced martensite and larger grains are developed due to the static
recrystallization inside deformed grains. With increasing annealing
time in the range of 5– 15 min the size of recrystallized grains is in-
creased but their fraction is decreased due to the growth of UFG grainsfrom grain boundary areas of elongated grains toward the interior re-
gions. Therefore, the increased elongation due to the growth of re-
crystallized large grains is compensated by the e ﬀect of the increasing
the fraction of ﬁne grains developed as a result of the reversion of strain
induced martensite. So that during annealing in the time range of
5–15 min the elongation remains almost constant. The higher growth
rate of UFG austenite grains compared with the growth rate of staticallyrecrystallized grains results in the uniform microstructure after an-
nealing for 25 min ( Fig. 8(e)). It is deduced by comparing Fig. 12 (a)
and (b) that the elongation of cold rolled AISI 321 steel is increasedsigniﬁcantly during annealing at 900 °C compared with annealing at
700 °C. It should be mentioned that the higher elongation with an-nealing at 900 °C is due to the occurrence of dynamic recrystallization
inside elongated austenite grains and the considerable growth of UFG
austenite grains developed in the early stage of annealing from strain
induced martensie.

3724. Conclusions
In the present investigation the AISI 321 austenitic stainless steel
was subjected to cold rolling and subsequent annealing in the tem-
perature range of 700– 900 °C and the resultant microstructures and
mechanical properties were investigated. The main results are asbellow:
1. The ﬁbrous microstructure is achieved after cold rolling with 80%
thickness reduction. This microstructure is consisted of elongated
austenite grains where the inner regions of grains experience lower
strains and appear as bright contrast in the optical micrographs. But
the grain boundary regions of elongated grains experience higher
strains and appear in dark contrast in optical micrograph. These
regions contain intersected shear bands and strain induced mar-
tensite phase.
2. The volume fraction of strain induced martensite is increased with
increasing rolling reduction. After 90% thickness reduction, the 50%
of microstructure is composed of strain induced martensite phase.
3. During annealing at 700 °C for di ﬀerent durations the combination
of ultra ﬁne grained austenite and the elongated primary austenite
grains observed in the microstructure.
4. At the early stages of annealing at 700 °C the elongation to failure is
increased due to the occurrence of recovery inside primary austenitegrains. In contrast, the elongation remains constant with further
annealing at this temperature due to the e ﬀect of the ultra ﬁne grains
formed as a result of the martensite to austenite reverse transfor-mation.
5. The bimodal grain structure is obtained after annealing at 900 °C for
5, 10, and 15 min as a result of the concurrent occurrence of staticrecrystallization in the elongated austenite grains and martensite toaustenite reversion in the primary austenite grain boundaries.
6. The good combination of strength and elongation was achieved by
the formation of bimodal microstructures where the coarse grains
resulted from static recrystallization improves elongation compared
with cold rolled sample and ﬁner grains resulted from martensite to
austenite reversion improves strength compared with initial coarsegrained microstructure.
7. During annealing for 25 min at 900 °C, the uniform grain structure
obtained due to the higher grows rate of UFG austenite grains
compared with recrystallized coarse grains.

Abstract: A new processing route to produce Ultraﬁne-Grained Dual-Phase steel has been proposed,
involving cold-rolling and subsequent intercritical annealing of a ﬁbrous ferrite–martensite starting
structure. Ultraﬁne-grained DP (UFG-DP) steel with an average ferrite grain size of about ~2.7 m
and an average martensite island size of ~2.9 m was achieved. Tensile testing revealed superior
mechanical properties (the ultimate tensile strength of 1267 MPa and uniform elongation of 8.2%) for
the new DP steel in comparison with the ﬁbrous DP steels. The superior mechanical properties are
attributed to the inﬂuence of microstructure reﬁnement on the work-hardening and fracture behavior.

1. Introduction
The increasing demand for weight reduction with high safety performance in the automotive
industry has led to the continuous development of advanced high strength steels (AHSS), such as
dual-phase (DP) and transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) steels [ 1–4]. Compared to other
high-strength steel grades, DP steels involve a leaner alloy addition and can be produced using
well-adapted processes, while they show attractive balance between strength and formability [ 5–8].
However, the new wave of fuel-economy regulations demands better combination between strength
and ductility/toughness, so that the stringent design requirements can be met. One of the promising
approaches achieving this desire is to produce DP steels with ultraﬁne grain size. It has been well
known that grain reﬁnement of DP steels leads to huge strength enhancement without apparent
sacriﬁce of plasticity [ 9–20]. While, single-phase UFG materials usually show high strength but limited
ductility [ 19]. Previous studies [ 16] attributed the beneﬁts of UFG-DP to optimizations of strain
hardening rate, martensite plasticity and interface cohesion. A better understanding of the grain
reﬁnement is worthy to be studied further to optimize mechanical properties of UFG-DP steels.
However, the successful production of UFG-DP remains a challenge, which relies on starting
with the fine-scale microstructure and maintaining the structural scale during intercritical annealing.
The fine-scale initial microstructures can be achieved by severe plastic deformation (SPD). Shin et al. [ 21]
Materials 2018 ,11, 1399; doi:10.3390/ma11081399 www.mdpi.com/journal/materialsMaterials 2018 ,11, 1399 2 of 11
and Park et al. [ 22] applied the equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) (accumulated strain of ~4) to
generate a ferritic initial structure with the grain size of ~1 m and ~0.2 m, respectively. Tsuji [ 23]
used the technique of accumulative roll bonding (ARB) to refine the initial ferrite grain size to 1.3 m
with the equivalent strain of 4.8. In addition, fast heating during intercritical annealing was found
to be important to maintain the ultrafine grain size, which is allowed by the pinning of ferrite grain
boundaries by the formation of austenite islands [ 6,7,24–26]. It is reported that the grain growth of
ferrite can only be significantly suppressed with the heating rate of 300 K/s [ 17]. Moreover, playing
with the interaction between ferrite recrystallization and austenite formation, the production of UFG-DP
microstructures can be eased by increasing the Manganese content, which decreases the temperature of
austenite formation and more efficient suppression of ferrite grain growth was resulted in [6].
The abovementioned techniques involving SPD, fast heating and increased Manganese alloying
are, on the other hand, bringing barriers to the industrial manufacturing of UFG-DP . The objective of the
present work is to propose a new processing route for UFG-DP by designing the initial microstructure
before intercritical annealing. The initial microstructure is a cold-rolled ﬁbrous ferrite–martensite
dual-phase steel. In this ﬁne-scale initial structure, the dispersion of martensite plates/islands offers
high density of preferred nucleation sites for austenite formation, which enhances the efﬁciency of
pinning the migration of ferrite grain boundaries during intercritical annealing. This processing route
proved effective in achieving UFG-DP microstructures. The mechanical properties of the UFG-DP were
examined by uniaxial tensile tests. The inﬂuence of microstructure reﬁnement on the work-hardening
and fracture behavior are discussed.
2. Materials and Methods
The chemical composition of the steel was shown in Table 1, which was determined using
the vacuum emission spectroscopy. The ingot was prepared in a 20 kg vacuum induction furnace
with a thickness of 50 mm. The slabs were cut to samples of 40 308 mm for processing and
mechanical testing.

Fe Balance
For the selection of processing temperatures, A1 and A3 temperatures were calculated using
Equations (1) and (2) [27]:
A1=723 10.7Mn  16.9Ni +29.1Si +16.9Cr +290As +6.38W (1)
A3=910 203C0.5 15.2Ni +44.7Si +31.5Mo +104V +13.1W (2)
A1 and A3 temperatures were estimated as 755C and 887C, respectively. The processing route
to develop UFG-DP microstructures is shown in Figure 1. Firstly, the samples were austenitized at
920C for 60 min followed by water quench to obtain a martensitic microstructure. Then, an intercritical
annealing (820C, 10 min) was performed to generate a ﬁbrous ferrite–martensite microstructure.
The steel sheet were then cold rolled by 85% reduction in thickness in order to reﬁne the structural
scale. Finally, another intercritical annealing was performed on the cold-rolled sheets at 780C, 800C
or 820C for 1.5 min, followed by water quenching. During the ﬁnal intercritical annealing processing,
in order to achieve relatively fast heating rate, the steel samples were submitted to the furnace at the
temperature of 780C, 800C or 820C. The samples are placed in direct contact with the heated iron
blocks for an efﬁcient heat transfer.Materials 2018 ,11, 1399 3 of 11
Microstructural characterization was carried out along the plane perpendicular to the transverse
direction (TD) and parallel to rolling direction (RD). The sectioned specimens were mounted, ground,
polished and etched with 5% Nital solution. The microstructures were examined by optical microscope
(OM) and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM, Quant 250 FEG). The SEM micrographs were
quantitatively analyzed by image analysis following the procedure in [ 6] so that the volume fraction of
martensite and the average grain size of ferrite can be measured.
The steel sheets were cut into dog-bone shaped specimens for tensile testing, with the longititudinal
direction parallel to the rolling direction. The gage length, width and thickness of the tensile
specimens were 10 mm, 2.5 mm and 1.2 mm, respectively. Uniaxial tensile tests were performed
on an electromechanical universal testing machine (LFM-20kN) with a strain rate of 310 3s 1at
room temperature. Following the procedure in the literature [ 28], load-deformation curves of the
samples was tested and in order to get true strain some data processing was done. The displacement
of the sample holder was measurement, and the strain was calculated by dividing the gauge length
by such displacement, after calibrating the stiffness of the testing machine. The yield strength was
defined as the flow stress at 0.2% plastic strain. The uniform elongation was defined by the true strain
at the moment of necking according to the Consid ère ecriterion [ 29]. Three samples were tested for
each microstructural state. The fracture surfaces of the broken tensile specimens were observed under
the SEM.

3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Microstructure Evolution During Processing
The as-received microstructure consists of a mixture of pearlite and ferrite (Figure 2a). The volume
fraction of pearlite was measured as 40%, and the ferrite grain size is 30 m. After annealing at 920C
for 60 min, a martensitic microstructure was attained (Figure 2b). The small amount of ferrite is
inevitable in this steel grade due to insufﬁcient quenchability.Materials 2018 ,11, 1399 4 of 11
Figure 2. Optical micrographs of ( a) as-received microstructure; and SEM micrographs of ( b) the
microstructure after annealing at 920C for 60 min.
The martensitic initial structure was annealed at 820C for 10 min to produce the ﬁbrous DP steels.
The microstructure consists of 47 vol % ferrite and 53 vol % martensite (Figure 3a), and the ﬁbrous
morphology is considered as inheriting from the lath martensite during intercritical annealing [ 30].
The distribution of martensite islands is uniform within the microstructure, and banding structure,
which is usually signiﬁcant in Mn-alloyed steels due to Mn segregation, cannot be observed. In order
to reﬁne the structural scale, cold-rolling to 85% thickness reduction was performed. As shown in
Figure 3b, the dual-phase microstructure is well orientated along the rolling direction, with the mean
spacing between martensite islands dramatically reduced. The martensite islands show the features
of co-deformation with ferrite during cold-rolling, although the martensitic strength is much higher
than ferrite.
Figure 3. SEM morphologies of the ﬁbrous DP microstructures after ( a) water quench;
and ( b) cold rolling.
Figure 4a–c shows the microstructures after the ﬁnal intercritical annealing at 780C, 800C
and 820C for 1.5 min, respectively. These microstructures show a uniform distribution of the
equiaxed UFG ferrite grains (2~3 m) with the embedded UFG martensite islands (2~3 m), indicating
that the processing route works well in achieving ultraﬁne-grained dual-phase microstructures.
Compared to the ﬁbrous dual phase microstructure, UFG-DP (annealing at the same temperature
820C) microstructure has a different martensite volume fraction, consisting of 38 vol % martensite
(Figure 4d). This is mainly attributed to the soaking time. During the processing to obtain UFG-DP ,Materials 2018 ,11, 1399 5 of 11
the short soaking time was used in order to avoid substantial grain growth during annealing. However,
the short soaking time of 1.5 min probably led to incomplete formation of the austenite. The ﬁbrous
DP and the UFG-DP have different martensite volume fractions. Figure 4d also shows that increasing
the annealing temperature did not result in a larger ferrite grain size. During intercritically annealing
the microstructure as shown in Figure 3b, the austenite phase preferably forms from the existing
carbon-rich martensite islands. The amount of austenite phase is increased at a higher annealing
temperature, which is indicated by the evolution of martensite volume fraction after quenching. On the
other hand, the driving force to recrystallization and grain growth of ferrite is large due to the heavy
cold-rolling. The dispersion of easily formed austenite dispersions acts as efﬁcient pinning points to
the migration of ferrite grain boundaries, which results in the fact that the ﬁne scale of the structure
survived after the heat treatment. However, the recrystallization of ferrite is not fully suppressed,
which explains the equiaxed ferrite grain shape. Moreover, as shown in the Figure 5, low-density
of precipitations are observed in some ferrite grains. This could be explained by the procedure of
the heat treatment. The intercritical annealing was performed on the ferrite–martensite mixture,
where the Carbon is mainly in solute and concentrated in the martensite phase. The relatively fast
heating rate also helped in restraining carbide precipitation and spheroidization. The contribution of
such low-density precipitations to the ﬂow stress is considered to be the second-order effect, when
comparing with the effect of grain reﬁnement. The abovementioned microstructure evolution during
the processing steps was shown schematically in Figure 6.

3.2. Tensile Properties
The engineering stress-strain curves of as-received sample, the ﬁbrous DP steels and the UFG-DP
steels are compared in Figure 7a. All the samples show continuous yielding behavior, and the level
of ﬂow stress is signiﬁcantly increased when the microstructure is reﬁned. Figure 7b shows the true
stress-strain curves and the corresponding evolution of strain hardening rate of the UFG-DP steels.
All the UFG-DP steels show a high strain hardening rate in the initial stages of the deformation, which
decreases gradually with strain. This salient strain hardening behavior enables the DP steels to possess
a low yield ratio, high tensile strength and relatively high uniform elongation. As compared to the
ﬁbrous DP steels, the UFG-DP steels present both higher yield strength and tensile strength (Figure 7c).
This could be attributed to the reduced ferrite grain size in UFG-DP . The ferrite in ﬁbrous DP and
in UFG-DP could behave differently. In a certain sense, the structural scale of ferrite in ﬁbrous DP
is also in UFG regime in that the thickness of the ferrite lamella is about 2 m. However, the free
path of dislocations along the length of the ferrite lamella could be rather large (tens of microns,
comparable with the prior austenite grain size), resulting in a large effective ferrite grain size. Indeed,
the yield strength of ﬁbrous DP steel is lower than the UFG-DP steels. In addition, although the size of
marteniste islands is also reduced in UFG-DP , this is presumably not contributing to the increase in
martensitic strength because the main metallurgical factor determining the strength of martensite is
carbon content [31].
Moreover, according to Figure 7d, the uniform elongation (UE) of the UFG-DP1, 2 and 3 steel
(samples after the ﬁnal intercritical annealing at 780, 800 and 820C for 1.5 min.) is decreased with
increasing annealing temperature. When the annealing temperature is increased, the martensite
volume fraction ( Vm) is increased while the ferrite grain size (d f) is reduced (Figure 4d). Both of these
factors tend to decrease the uniform elongation of the DP steels [6,20].
An interesting point of UFG-DP is the excellent uniform elongation when comparing to other
UFG single-phase ferrous alloys. It is reported that the ferritic steels with a grain size less than
1m usually exhibit poor uniform elongation [ 19], but recent studies on grain reﬁnement in DP
steels show that the improvement of strength is not necessarily accompanied by a huge decrease of
uniform elongation [6,32] . This could be attributed to the unique effect of simultaneously decreasing
the size of ferrite grains and martensite particles. During formation, the plastic strain incompatibility
between ferrite and martensite induces a large number of geometrically necessary dislocations
(GNDs) in the ferrite areas near the interfaces. The GND sources are increased with larger of the
ferrite/martensite interfacial regions [ 19]. Although the plastic incompatibility between the ferrite
and martensite is weakened by grain reﬁnement, the huge dislocation multiplication in ferrite grains
and the consequential additional back stress in the local region enables the UFG-DP microstructure to
strain harden, resulting in better ductility than UFG single-phase metals [33].Materials 2018 ,11, 1399 8 of 11

3.3. Fractography
Observations of fracture surfaces of the UFG-DP are shown in Figure 8. All fracture surfaces reveal
a mixture of cleavage facets and dimples. No large dimples were observed, which indicates that void
growth is limited during the fracture processes. Instead, the dimples were all small and shallow. When
the intercritical temperature increases, the area fraction of cleavage facets increases and the sample
exhibits a more brittle manner. It is reported that the DP steels with a high volume fraction of the
martensite could undergo brittle fracture at ambient temperature [ 6]. The brittle fracture of DP steels is
usually induced by a micromorphology of interconnected martensite network [ 34,35]. Compared to
isolated martensite islands, the martensite network in DP steels restricts the ﬂow of plasticity in the
ferrite by conﬁning the slip systems [ 34] and induces a high degree of stress triaxiality. Presumably,
the damage nucleation occurs at the martensite phase that has lower toughness and bears higher
stress level. Once the martensite fractures, the initiated crack in martensite imposes a concentrated
stress ﬁeld and also a high degree of stress triaxiality in the neighboring ferrite grain. In addition,
signiﬁcant elastic energy, which is stored due to the deformation of high-strength materials, can be
released once the crack starts propagating, resulting in unstable crack growth. The abovementioned
stress concentration, stress triaxialty and rapid release of elastic energy trigger the cleavage cracking in
ferrite neighboring the damaged martensite particles. It is the premature cracking in martensite that
controls the fracture resistance and/or fracture strain in the UFG-DP steels. Hence, with an increasingMaterials 2018 ,11, 1399 9 of 11
amount of martensite phase, there will be more brittle features on the fracture surface and a lower
fracture strain is seen in as shown by the area reduction in Figure 7d.

4. Conclusions
1. Ultraﬁne-grained ferrite–martensite dual-phase steels were produced by intercritically annealing
the cold-rolled ﬁbrous DP microstructure. The generated dual-phase steels consisted of UFG
ferrite and uniformly distributed martensite islands. Ferrite grain size and martensite island size
were ~2.7 m and ~2.9 m, respectively.
2. The UFG-DP steels exhibit an excellent strain hardening behavior, which is affected by the grain
reﬁnement of both ferrite and martensite, enabling the simultaneous enhancement of UTS and
UE to 1.2 GPa and 8%, respectively.
3. The UFG-DP steels fractured in a partially brittle manner. A mixture of small dimples and
cleavage facets was observed in the fracture surfaces. The fracture strain characterized by area
reduction was decreased when the volume fraction of martensite was increased.
