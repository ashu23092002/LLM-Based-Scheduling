The 80% cold rolled samples were then annealed in the temperature range of 700 \u2013900 \u00b0C with\ndi\ufb00erent durations. The microstructural evolutions during cold rolling and subsequent annealing were in-\nvestigated by XRD analysis, optical and scanning electron microscopy, and feritscope analysis. The mechanical\nproperties were evaluated by room temperature tensile testing. Results showed that the amount of strain inducedmartensite is increased with increasing the rolling reduction. Annealing at 700 \u00b0C for 2 min resulted in the\nsimultaneous increase of tensile strength and elongation due to the formation of ultra \ufb01ne grain austenite. By\nannealing at 900 \u00b0C for 5, 10, and 15 min the bimodal grain structure was obtained as a result of the occurrence\nof static recrystallization and martensite to austenite reverse transformation simultaneously. Results of tensile\ntesting showed that the good combination of strength and elongation is obtained by the formation of bimodal\ngrain structure.\n1. Introduction\nAustenitic stainless steels are used in a wide range of applications\ndue to their several desirable characteristics such as the combination of\nthe resistance to oxidation at high temperatures as a result of the for-\nmation of passive chromium oxide (Cr 2O3)\ufb01lm on the surface [1], and\nthe creep resistance [2,3] , which makes them suitable for high tem-\nperature applications. For example, austenitic stainless steels are suc-\ncessfully used in the power generation industry at temperatures above\n650 \u00b0C and remain in service for more than 100,000 h [4]. Although,\naustenitic stainless steels have a good corrosion resistance [5]and\nformability [6]but their yield strength is relatively low. For example,\nthe 0.2% o \ufb00set yield strength of coarse grained AISI 316 austenitic\nstainless steel is around 250 MPa at ambient temperature [7]. There-\nfore, increasing the strength of stainless steels seems necessary to ex-tend their application toward heavier loading conditions. In this regard,\none of the ways to improve the strength of austenitic stainless steels is\nthe addition of alloying elements such as nitrogen which increases\ntensile and yield strength with the expense of their ductility and\nformability [8]. Another e \ufb00ective way is the grain re \ufb01nement which\nincreases the strength and toughness without impairing ductility[9,10] . The commonly used techniques for grain re \ufb01nement are based\non two di \ufb00erent approaches: severe plastic deformation (SPD) [11] andadvanced thermomechanical processing (ATMP) [12]. During severe\nplastic deformation, a very high levels of plastic strain is imposed on\nsample through repetitive processing and the grain re \ufb01nement is\nachieved by the mechanism similar to continuous dynamic re-crystallization where the grain boundaries are developed from dis-\nlocation cells as a result of the extended recovery and increase of the\nmisorientation angle with continued straining [13]. The main draw-\nbacks of SPD techniques are the batch nature of these processes and alsothe small dimensions of processed samples which make them suitable\nfor the synthesis of the laboratory scale samples instead of the industrial\nscale production of ultra \ufb01ne grained and nanostructured steels. In\ncontrast with SPD processing, the advanced thermomechanical pro-cesses can be performed in industrial scale to produce ultra \ufb01ne grained\nsteels products such as sheets and strips. For plain carbon and micro-alloyed steels the advanced thermomechanical processes are based on\ndi\ufb00erent approaches such as strain induced austenite to ferrite trans-\nformation [14], rolling in the inter critical temperatures range [15,16] ,\ncold rolling and annealing of martensitic steels [17]. In the case of\naustenitic stainless steels, the austenite phase is stable at ambienttemperature and austenite to ferrite transformation which is the base of\nthermomechanical processing of plain carbon steels does not occur\nduring cooling. The new thermomechanical treatment for austenitic\nstainless steel is the heavy cold deformation which is followed by\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.msea.2018.09.012\nReceived 10 June 2018; Received in revised form 5 August 2018; Accepted 5 September 2018\u204eCorresponding author.\nE-mail address: eghbali@sut.ac.ir (B.

In this process the austenite phase is transformed to\nmetastable martensite during cold deformation and the ultra \ufb01ne\ngrained microstructure is obtained through the martensite to austenite\nreversion annealing [20]. The cold rolling and reversion annealing\nprocess has been successfully performed on di \ufb00erent types of austenitic\nstainless steels such as AISI 201 [21], AISI 301 [22], AISI 304 [23,24]\nsteels and the pronounced grain re \ufb01nement was observed. Careful in-\nspection of literature shows that the response of the Ti stabilized aus-\ntenitic stainless steel (AISI 321) to the cold working and reversion an-\nnealing process has not been studied yet. Therefore, in the present\ninvestigation, the AISI 321 austenitic stainless steel was subjected to\ncold rolling with 80% reduction and the formation of strain induced\nmartensite was studied using optical microscopy and x-ray di \ufb00raction\nanalysis. Also, obtained ultra- \ufb01ne grained microstructure after rever-\nsion annealing was characterized and its impact on mechanical prop-\nerties was evaluated using tensile testing.\n2. Material and experimental procedure\nIn the present investigation, the AISI 321 austenitic stainless steel\nwas used in the form of a sheet with a thickness of 10 mm. The chemical\ncomposition of the investigated steel is shown in Table 1. The sheet was\ncut into smaller pieces with dimensions of 150 \u00d7 25 mm to be suitablefor cold rolling. All pieces were solution annealed at 1200 \u00b0C for 15 min\nand then quenched in water to obtain a fully austenitic structure. The\ncold rolling was then applied at room temperature with a thickness\nreduction of 10%, 30%, 60%, 80%, and 90%. After a few passes, the\npieces were cooled in water to prevent temperature rise during rolling.\nCold rolled samples were then cut to be used for metallography, tensile\ntesting and further processing with reversion annealing according to the\nprocedure shown in Fig. 1. The reversion annealing was performed in\nthe temperature range of 700\u2013 900 \u00b0C for di \ufb00erent durations (2, 5, 10,\n15, and 25 min). Samples were quenched in water after the speci \ufb01ed\nannealing times. The microstructures of annealed samples were in-\nvestigated using optical microscopy. The common metallographic pro-\ncedure was used for preparation of samples for optical microscopy\nanalysis. For this reason, the sample surfaces were ground using silicon\ncarbide papers from 100 to 2500 grit and then mechanically polished\nusing 0.05 \u00b5m alumina suspension. The electrolytic etching in the so-\nlution of 50% nitric acid and distilled water, by applying the current\ndensity of 0.1 mA/cm\n2, was used to reveal the grain structure. Optical\nmicrographs were obtained using Olympus PMG3 microscope. X-raydi\ufb00raction analysis was performed for identi \ufb01cation of di \ufb00erent phases\nin the cold rolled samples. For this reason, the Bruker Advanced D8di\ufb00ractometer was used with the step size of 0.1 and step time of 1 s. A\nXL30 scanning electron microscope equipped with EDS was used toidentify the chemical composition of inclusion.\nAlso, the volume fraction of martensite phase at cold rolled samples\nwas determined using Fischer FMP30 feritscope. The mechanical\nproperties of samples annealed at di \ufb00erent temperatures and durations\nwas evaluated by tensile testing at room temperature. Tensile sampleswere prepared according to the ASTM E8 standard. Tensile tests were\nconducted using Gotech AI-7000-LA20 testing machine with the cross\nhead speed of 0.1 mm/min and the average of two tests was used for\ndetermination of tensile strength and elongation to failure of each\nsample.3. Results and discussion\n3.1. Microstructural evolution during initial annealing\nFig. 2(a) represents the optical micrograph of AISI 321 austenitic\nstainless steel before etching. The TiN inclusions are easily dis-\ntinguished as yellow color particles distributed uniformly in the matrix.\nFig. 2(b) shows the microstructure of AISI 321 steel after annealing at\n1200 \u00b0C for 15 min. As can be seen, the microstructure is composed of\naustenite phase with mean grain size about 200 \u00b5m. Also, some an-\nnealing twins are observable inside austenite grains in conjunction with\nTiN inclusions. For further con \ufb01rmation, the X-ray di \ufb00raction analysis\nwas performed on annealed steel. The di \ufb00raction pattern of as annealed\nAISI 321 steel is shown in Fig. 2 (c). It is obvious that only the austenite\npeaks are distinguished in the peak pro \ufb01le of the annealed material.\nTherefore, the results con \ufb01rmed that only austenite phase exists in the\nannealed microstructure.\n3.2. Microstructural evolution during cold rolling\nIt is well known that the cross slip of dislocations in face centered\ncubic (FCC) materials become di \ufb03cult with decreasing stacking fault\nenergy [25]. Austenitic stainless steels are among the low stacking fault\nenergy materials and their microstructures are prone to dynamic re-\ncrystallization when deforming at high temperatures [26]. Also, the low\ntemperature deformation of austenitic stainless steels such as coldrolling is accompanied by the formation of deformation induced twins\nand subsequent austenite to martensite transformation [27]. In this\nclass of materials, mechanical twins are formed as a result of the suc-cessive accumulation of stacking faults on the {111} slip planes. But,\nthe \u03b5martensite is formed due to the alternative pile up of stacking\nfaults. The stacking fault energy (SFE) of austenitic stainless steels canbe evaluated using the following expression [28]:\n\u239b\n\u239d\u239e\u23a0=\u2212 + \u2212 \u2212 + SFEmJ\nmCr Ni Mn Mo 53 0.7(% ) 6.2(% ) 3.2(% ) 9.3(% )\n2\nAccording to the above equation, the SFE of the investigated aus-\ntenitic stainless steel is calculated to be 22 mJ/m2. If the SFE of aus-\ntenitic stainless steel is higher than 20 mJ/m2, the \u03b5martensite is not\nformed during cold deformation. In this case, intersected mechanical\ntwins are formed at lower strains and the \u03b1\u0301martensite is developed at\nhigher imposed strains mainly in the intersected regions of twinboundaries. In contrast, when the SFE is lower than 20 mJ/m\n2, the \u03b5\nmartensite is formed at initial stage of cold deformation and the \u03b1\u0301\nmartensite is developed with further straining [28]. It is concluded that\nthe \u03b5martensite is not formed during deformation of the investigated\nsteel because the SFE value is higher than 20 mJ/m2.Fig. 3 shows the\nmicrostructure of AISI 321 steel after cold rolling with 80% reduction.\nIn this optical micrograph the dark regions contain shear bands,Table 1\nChemical composition of as received AISI 321 austenitic stainless steel (%wt.).\nCS i M n C r N i M o T i NF e\n0.036 0.421 1.910 17.154 8.620 0.374 0.303 0.013 Bal.\nFig. 1.

It was\nwell established that the microstructure of heavily cold worked metals\nis in the \ufb01brous form. This type of microstructure is consisted of in-\ntermittent layers of severely deformed and somewhat low strainedmaterial [29]. For evaluation of the e \ufb00ect of plastic strain on the\namount of strain induced martensite phase, the AISI 321 austeniticstainless steel was subjected to di \ufb00erent rolling reductions and the X-\nray di \ufb00raction patterns were compared with that of as annealed ma-\nterial. Fig. 4 shows the XRD patterns of as annealed and cold deformed\nAISI 321 steel after 30%, 60% and 80% rolling reductions. It can beseen, that the annealed materials doesn \u2019t exhibit any peaks of the BCClattice structure (martensite phase). However after 30% rolling reduc-tion, the martensite peaks are appeared in the X-ray di \ufb00raction pattern\nbut the austenite peaks are still presents with higher intensities whichdemonstrates that the austenite to martensite transformation was in-\nitiated but the higher fraction of microstructure is composed of auste-\nnite phase. Unlike 30% cold rolled steel, the peak intensities of the\naustenite phase after 60% cold rolling is much less than martensite\nphase, which indicates the progress of the transformation of deforma-\ntion induced austenite to martensite phase. Also, after 80% cold rolling\nthe peak intensities of the austenite phase are very weak or the peaks\nare disappeared. The feritscope was used for determination of the\nmartensite contents of the cold rolled steel. It must be mentioned that\nthe feritscope device measures the ferrite or martensite content in the\nmicrostructure of dual phase steels according to the magnetic induction\nmethod. In this method, a magnetic \ufb01eld generated by a coil enters into\ninteraction with the magnetic components of the specimen. Thechanges in the magnetic \ufb01eld induce a voltage proportional to the\nferrite content in a second coil. Fig. 5 shows the variations of martensite\ncontent with the amount of the reduction during cold rolling. As it is\nclear the amount of strain induced martensite is increased with rolling\nreduction and comprises about the 50% of microstructure after 90%\ncold rolling. It is worth noting that the martensite phase in austenitic\nstainless steels is developed in the interesting regions of shear bands\nand deformation twins. The number of intersecting regions is increased\nwith increasing the amount of cold working and consequently the vo-lume fraction of martensite phase is increased.\n3.3.

In addition, the dark regions in Fig. 7 are heavily\ndeformed austenite which was transformed to \u03b1\u0301martensite during de-\nformation, and the ultra \ufb01ne grained austenite formed from martensite\nphase during annealing. Therefore, some regions with ultra \ufb01ne grained\naustenite phase are formed in the microstructure after annealing at\n700 \u030aC. Also, it is seen that the volume fraction of ultra \ufb01ne grained\naustenite is increased with increasing annealing time from 2 to 25 min.It is observed that after annealing for 25 min at 700 \u00b0C, near the 70% of\nmicrostructure is transformed to ultra \ufb01ne grained austenite. Also, shear\nbands inside the elongated austenite grains were disappeared due to theannealing e \ufb00ect (see Fig. 7(d)). It is worth noting that the annealing\ntemperature of 700 \u030a\u00b0C is not higher enough to trigger static re-\ncrystallization inside cold rolled austenite (bright regions in Fig. 7)\nduring annealing so that the elongated austenite grains are observed inall of the annealed microstructures.\nFig. 8 represents the optical microstructures of AISI 321 austenitic\nstainless steel after cold rolling and annealing at 900 \u030aC for di \ufb00erent\ndurations. As can be seen, after annealing for 2 min at 900 \u00b0C ( Fig. 8(a)),\nthe microstructure is composed of austenite grains elongated in the\nrolling directions with shear bands aligned parallel to each other andultra\ufb01ne austenite grains developed in some regions between two\nneighboring elongated grains. After 5 min annealing ( Fig. 8(b)), some\nequiaxed grains are observed inside elongated austenite grains in con-\njunction with the ultra \ufb01ne grains developed as a consequence of the\nreversion of strain induced martensite to austenite phase. It is alsoworth to note that the static recrystallization of cold worked austenite\ngrains is not complete after annealing for 5 min and the boundaries\nbetween elongated grains are observable indicating the cold worked\nfeatures. In Fig. 8 (c), the microstructure after 10 min annealing at900 \u00b0C, it is seen that the fraction and the size of recrystallized grains\ninside primary austenite grains (cold worked grains) is increased\ncompared with the microstructure of annealed sample for 5 min. It is\nalso apparent that the mean grain size of the ultra \ufb01ne austenite grains\ndeveloped as a result of the martensite to austenite inverse transfor-mation is increased with increasing the annealing time to 10 min. As\nseen in Fig. 8(c), the bimodal grain structure is developed after an-\nnealing at 900 \u00b0C for 10 min which is consisted of the intermittent layersof recrystallized grains and \ufb01ner grains developed as a result of the\nmartensite to austenite reversion. Increasing annealing time to 15 min(Fig. 8(d)) results in the growth of the two types of austenite grains but\nthe traces of the elongated primary austenite grains are remained due tothe limited growth of the recrystallized and reversion transformed\naustenite grains. Whereas, the uniform microstructure with equiaxed\naustenite grains are developed after annealing for 25 min at 900 \u00b0C and\nthe traces of the primary elongated austenite grains are disappeared\n(Fig. 8 (e)). As can be seen, the bimodal grain structure is replaced with\nuniform grain structure after prolonged annealing due to the highergrowth rate of the ultra \ufb01ne austenite grains compared with statically\nrecrystallized grains. Therefore, the di \ufb00erence between the grain sizes\nof these two types of austenite grains is decreased with increasing the\nannealing duration and \ufb01nally the uniform grain structure is obtained.\nIt is worth to note that the high amounts of Ti is added to AISI 321austenitic stainless steel to prevent grain boundary sensitization at high\ntemperatures. This amounts of Ti (for example 0.32% wt. in the in-\nvestigated steel) is high enough to form di \ufb00erent\n types of precipitates\nand inclusions. It is well stablished that the TiN inclusions are formed\nduring solidi \ufb01cation process and remain stable upon cooling to ambient\ntemperature [29]. This type of inclusions are in the size of several\nmicrometer and distributed uniformly in the austenite matrix. Also, it\nhas been demonstrated that the nanometer sized TiC and Ti(C, N)\nprecipitates are formed in the matrix of Ti modi \ufb01ed steels [30].\nTherefore, the interaction of nanometer sized precipitates with auste-\nnite grain boundaries decreases the boundary mobility and hinder the\ngrowth of austenite grains. Also, the coarse TiN inclusions provides\npreferred nucleation sites for static recrystallization during annealing\nwhich is called particle stimulated nucleation (PSN) [31]. Accordingly,\nthe both mentioned mechanisms result in higher levels of grain re-\ufb01nement in AISI 321 steel compared with other grades of austenitic\nstainless steels.\nFig. 9 shows the optical microstructures of cold rolled AISI 321\naustenitic stainless steel after annealing for 25 min at di \ufb00erent tem-\nperatures. As mentioned, at annealing temperature of 700 \u00b0C the com-\nbination of ultra \ufb01ne and primary elongated austenite grains are ob-\nserved after 25 min annealing ( Fig. 9(a)). Increasing annealing\ntemperature to 750 \u00b0C, results in the growth of reverted austenite\ngrains. Careful inspection of Fig. 9 (b) reveals that the shear bands are\nFig. 5.

Therefore, the elongation to failure is a \ufb00ected by\nthe size and volume fraction of these two types of austenite grains.\nFiner austenite grains are developed as a result of the reversion of strain\ninduced martensite and larger grains are developed due to the static\nrecrystallization inside deformed grains. With increasing annealing\ntime in the range of 5\u2013 15 min the size of recrystallized grains is in-\ncreased but their fraction is decreased due to the growth of UFG grainsfrom grain boundary areas of elongated grains toward the interior re-\ngions. Therefore, the increased elongation due to the growth of re-\ncrystallized large grains is compensated by the e \ufb00ect of the increasing\nthe fraction of \ufb01ne grains developed as a result of the reversion of strain\ninduced martensite. So that during annealing in the time range of\n5\u201315 min the elongation remains almost constant. The higher growth\nrate of UFG austenite grains compared with the growth rate of staticallyrecrystallized grains results in the uniform microstructure after an-\nnealing for 25 min ( Fig. 8(e)). It is deduced by comparing Fig. 12 (a)\nand (b) that the elongation of cold rolled AISI 321 steel is increasedsigni\ufb01cantly during annealing at 900 \u00b0C compared with annealing at\n700 \u00b0C. It should be mentioned that the higher elongation with an-nealing at 900 \u00b0C is due to the occurrence of dynamic recrystallization\ninside elongated austenite grains and the considerable growth of UFG\naustenite grains developed in the early stage of annealing from strain\ninduced martensie.\nFig. 10.

Conclusions\nIn the present investigation the AISI 321 austenitic stainless steel\nwas subjected to cold rolling and subsequent annealing in the tem-\nperature range of 700\u2013 900 \u00b0C and the resultant microstructures and\nmechanical properties were investigated. The main results are asbellow:\n1. The \ufb01brous microstructure is achieved after cold rolling with 80%\nthickness reduction. This microstructure is consisted of elongated\naustenite grains where the inner regions of grains experience lower\nstrains and appear as bright contrast in the optical micrographs. But\nthe grain boundary regions of elongated grains experience higher\nstrains and appear in dark contrast in optical micrograph. These\nregions contain intersected shear bands and strain induced mar-\ntensite phase.\n2. The volume fraction of strain induced martensite is increased with\nincreasing rolling reduction. After 90% thickness reduction, the 50%\nof microstructure is composed of strain induced martensite phase.\n3. During annealing at 700 \u00b0C for di \ufb00erent durations the combination\nof ultra \ufb01ne grained austenite and the elongated primary austenite\ngrains observed in the microstructure.\n4. At the early stages of annealing at 700 \u00b0C the elongation to failure is\nincreased due to the occurrence of recovery inside primary austenitegrains. In contrast, the elongation remains constant with further\nannealing at this temperature due to the e \ufb00ect of the ultra \ufb01ne grains\nformed as a result of the martensite to austenite reverse transfor-mation.\n5. The bimodal grain structure is obtained after annealing at 900 \u00b0C for\n5, 10, and 15 min as a result of the concurrent occurrence of staticrecrystallization in the elongated austenite grains and martensite toaustenite reversion in the primary austenite grain boundaries.\n6. The good combination of strength and elongation was achieved by\nthe formation of bimodal microstructures where the coarse grains\nresulted from static recrystallization improves elongation compared\nwith cold rolled sample and \ufb01ner grains resulted from martensite to\naustenite reversion improves strength compared with initial coarsegrained microstructure.\n7. During annealing for 25 min at 900 \u00b0C, the uniform grain structure\nobtained due to the higher grows rate of UFG austenite grains\ncompared with recrystallized coarse grains.\nReferences\n[1]T.
