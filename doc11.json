An understanding of structure\u2013property was established through tensile tests, in conjunction\nwith scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope. The results show that the steel after intermediate\nquenching (IQ) consisting of \ufb01ne and \ufb01brous martensite exhibited the intermediate strength, highest elongation and the best\ncomprehensive performance of mechanical properties, whereas the steel subjected to intercritical annealing (IA) produced\na network martensite along ferrite grain boundaries, having the lowest strength and intermediate elongation. Besides, step\nquenching (SQ) resulted in a coarse and blocky ferrite\u2013martensite microstructure showing the worst mechanical properties\nof the three different heat-treatment conditions. The strain-hardening behavior was studied through the modi\ufb01ed Crussard\u2013\nJaoul model, indicating two stages of strain-hardening behavior for all three samples. The highest magnitude of strain-\nhardening ability was obtained by IQ annealing routes. The analysis of the fractured surface revealed that ferrite/martensite\ninterfaces are the most susceptible for microvoid nucleation. However, martensite microcracks were also observed in SQ\nsample, and the microvoids are nucleated within the ferrite grain in IA sample as well. The variations in strength,\nelongation, strain-hardening behavior and fracture mechanism of the steel with different heat-treatment schedules were\nfurther discussed in relation to the microstructural features.\nKEY WORDS: Dual-phase steel; Heat-treatment schedule; Strain-hardening behavior; Fracture mechanism\n1 Introduction\nWith the development of the modern automobile industry,\nthe application of lightweight components is a challenge. Due\nto the economic and ecological c onsiderations, the reduction\nin mass is desired. Dual-phase (DP) steel is low-carbon and\nlow-alloy steel with (10\u201330) v ol% of martensite and a ductile\nferrite matrix, which is widely used in the automotiveindustry because of the good co mbination of high strength\nand good formability at low production costs [ 1\u20134].\nDP steel is characterized by a continuous yielding\nbehavior with a low initial \ufb02ow stress and a high initial\nstrain-hardening rate [ 5\u20138]. These properties provide the\nadvantages over the conventional high-strength low-alloy\nsteels, while at the same time it also introduces some\ncertain risk factors [ 9], including strong stress/strain par-\ntitioning [ 10,11], strain localization [ 12,13] and damage\nevolution [ 14].\nThe mechanical properties of the dual-phase steels are\ndetermined by the shape, the size and the volume fraction of\nthe constituent phases. These, in turn, are dependent on the\nannealing parameters and alloying elements. So far, some\nresearchers have studied about the effect of the martensite\non the properties of ferrite\u2013martensite dual-phase steels,Available online at http://link.springer.com/journal/40195\n&Hong-Shuang Di\ndhshuang@mail.neu.edu.cn\n1State Key Laboratory of Rolling and Automation,\nNortheastern University, Shenyang 110819, China\n123Acta Metall.

    "page_2": "including the content [ 15,16], martensite morphology, dis-\ntribution martensite and the grain size [ 17\u201324].\nThe tensile properties of DP steels have been investi-\ngated widely. Many studies have presented an increase in\nthe tensile strength with increasing martensite volumefraction ( V\nm) of DP steels [ 15,16,25]. Maleque et al. [ 16]\nreported that the increase in the tensile strength could be\nobtained through the increase in the Vm. Bag et al. [ 15]\nfound that the optimal properties were achieved at *0.55\nVm. A further increase in Vmwas found to decrease the\ntensile strength.\nDas et al. [ 17] obtained different microstructures with\nsimilar Vmand found that a \ufb01ne \ufb01brous structure had a\nbene\ufb01cial effect on the mechanical properties. In refer-ences [ 26,27], the strain-hardening behavior, fracture\nmechanism and microvoid formation were correlated to the\nmartensite morphology and distribution. It was pointed outthat the martensite morphology affected the strain-hard-\nening and the fracture properties. Bhattacharyya et al. [ 28]\ndeveloped a model to describe the effect of the martensitemorphology on the initial plastic state of the ferrite matrix\nand the stress\u2013strain behavior of DP steels during loading.\nIn addition, Hu \u00a8seyin [ 29] and Bayram [ 30] also investi-\ngated the effect of the grain size of constituents on the\nmechanical properties of DP steels. They found that \ufb01ne\nmicrostructural constituents can provide the best combi-\nnation of strength and ductility of DP steel due to the\ndecrease in the stress/strain partitioning between ferrite andmartensite. All the studies showed that the morphology of\nmartensite had a signi\ufb01cant impact on the mechanical\nproperties of DP steels.\nIn case of conventional continuous annealing, the cold-\nrolled ferrite ?pearlite subjected to the intercritical\nannealing produced a chain-like network or banded structureof the martensite, leading to the decrease in the ductility.However, suitable heat-treatment procedures can produce\nexcellent ferrite\u2013martensite microstructure and thus theoptimal comprehensive mechanical properties. In this study,\nferrite\u2013martensite microstructure with different martensite\nmorphologies and contents were obtained through a carefuldesign of the heat-treatment schedules. A comparison of the\nmechanical properties among all the samples reveals that the\nsteel subjected to intermediate quenching (IQ) treatmentmay greatly improve the mechanical properties.\n2 Experimental\n2.1 Material\nAn industrial cold-rolled low-carbon steel sheet with an\ninitial thickness of 1.5 mm was investigated in the presentstudy.

Microstructure of the as-\nreceived state is shown in Fig. 1, which is composed of\n15 vol% pearlite and 85 vol% ferrite.\n2.2 Heat Treatment\nThe A\nc1and Ac3temperatures can be calculated by the\nempirical equations in Ref.

    "page_3": "In order to analyze the effect of the heat-treatment\nschedule on the microstructure and the tensile properties,the steel was subjected to three different processing\nschedules as illustrated in Fig. 2.\n1. Intermediate quenching (IQ): The steel was \ufb01rst\naustenized at 900 /C176C for 30 min and water-quenched.\nThen, an intercritical annealing was conducted at750/C176C for 60 min followed by water quenching\n(Fig. 2a).\n2. Intercritical annealing (IA): The intercritical annealing\nwas directly applied to the initial cold-rolled fer-\nrite?pearlite microstructure (Fig. 2b).\n3. Step quenching (SQ): After the austenization at 900 /C176C\nfor 30 min, the steel was cooled down to 750 /C176C at the\nrate of 1 /C176C/min and held for 60 min before the \ufb01nal\nwater quenching (Fig. 2c).\n2.3 Tensile Tests\nAccording to ASTM A370-07a standard, the tensile sam-\nples are prepared with a nominal gauge length of 50 mm\nand width of 12.5 mm. The tensile tests were carried out atroom temperature using a 100-kN Instron tensile machine\nat a crosshead speed of 2 mm/min.2.4 Microstructure Characterization\nMicrostructure examination was performed with a Leica\nDM 2500-M metallographic microscope (OM) and QuantaFEM 250 scanning electron microscope (SEM). The\ntransmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was\nconducted using FEI Tecnai G2F20S-TWIN microscope.Thin foils were electro-polished to perforation using a\ntwin-jet electro-polished device with an electrolyte con-\nsisting of 4% perchloric acid and 96% ethanol. The volumefraction of the martensite and the grain size of the ferrite\nwere obtained using the image-processing software, Image-\nPro-Plus.\n3 Results and Discussion\n3.1 Microstructure Evolution\nFigure 3shows the SEM micrographs of the samples after\nthe heat treatments, where ferrite\u2013martensite DP\nmicrostructure can be clearly identi\ufb01ed.

    "page_4": "For the IQ specimen, the intercritical annealing was\ninitiated from lath martensite substructure, which is able to\nprovide suf\ufb01cient nucleation sites for austenite formation\n[15], such as the prior austenite grain boundaries, the car-\nbide precipitates on prior austenite grain boundaries, the\nspheroids in ferrite and the \ufb01ne carbide arrays formed on\nthe prior martensite plate/lath boundaries. Finally, the \ufb01neand \ufb01brous morphologies of martensite were achieved.\nIn the case of IA treatment, pearlite colonies locate at\nthe ferrite grain boundaries as shown in Fig. 1. As pre-\nsented in [ 31\u201333], the austenite nucleates at the ferrite\u2013\npearlite interface and then grows into the ferrite after thefully dissolution of pearlite. Meanwhile, as a competitive\nevent, the nucleation of the austenite at the recrystallized\nferrite grain boundaries is also carried out and results in theformation of a network of austenite phase. After quenching\nfrom the intercritical temperature, a corresponding\nmartensite network is obtained (Fig. 3b).\nIn contrast to the IQ and IA samples, a blocky mor-\nphology of the martensite was shown in the SQ sample\n(Fig. 3c). In this process, the sample was \ufb01rst completely\naustenitized, before entering into the a?cregion.\nTherefore, the ferrite grain would nucleate at the austenite\ngrain boundaries and grow toward the austenite graininterior [ 33]. Meanwhile, austenite also grows at the same\ntime, such a case yielded coarse block martensite grains.\nImage analysis of the micrographs in Fig. 3revealed the\nlowest amounts of the martensite in the IA sample\n(Table 1). This can be explained as follows. Starting from\ncold-rolled \u2018\u2018ferrite ?pearlite\u2019\u2019 microstructure, the heavily\ndeformed ferrite grains would recrystallize upon heating tothe intercritical temperature. The nucleation of the\naustenite becomes unfavorable at moving ferrite bound-\naries [ 31], leading to the decreased volume fraction of the\naustenite and therefore less martensite after quenching.Compared with the IQ sample, austenite-to-ferrite trans-\nformation occurred during the intercritical annealing and\nthe ferrite nucleated primarily at the austenite grainboundaries. The difference in nucleation density of pro-\nduced phase between IQ and SQ samples plays an impor-\ntant role in determining the martensite volume fraction.\nFigure 4shows the TEM micrographs of the samples\nafter different heat-treatment schedules. As can be seenfrom \ufb01gures, high density of dislocation in the ferrite grains\nclose to the interface was identi\ufb01ed, which was a conse-\nquence of volume expansion associated with the austenite-to-martensite transformation. These dislocations are mobile\nand usually regarded as geometrically necessary disloca-\ntions, playing important roles in continuous yielding [ 34].\nThe absence of the bainite in the microstructure indicates\nthe good hardenability of the steels.\n3.2 Tensile Property\nThe engineering and true stress\u2013strain curves are presented\nin Fig. 5. Continuous yielding with the yield ratio below\n0.6 was observed in every sample, which is characteristic\nstress\u2013strain behavior of dual-phase steels [ 35,36].\nMechanical properties are summarized in Table 1. The\nSQ sample exhibits highest strength but lowest elongation,\nwhile the IA sample shows lowest strength and interme-diate elongation.

    "page_5": "moderate strength and highest magnitude of ductility were\nachieved in the IQ treatment. The product of ultimatestrength and uniform elongation (UTS 9UE) of the IQ\nsample (i.e., 92.9 J cm\n-3) is superior when compared to\nthat of other two samples (70.7 and 62.9 J cm-3for IA and\nSQ samples, respectively).\nBased on the rule of mixture, the difference in ultimate\nstrength (UTS) can be related to the martensite volumefraction ( V\nm) (Table 1). The better elongation [total elon-\ngation (TEL) and uniform elongation (UE)] of the IQ\nsample compared to other two samples could be ascribed tothe \ufb01ner grain structure and the \ufb01brous martensite uni-\nformly distributed in the ferrite matrix. Calcagnotto et al.\n[20,21] reported a more ef\ufb01cient load transfer between soft\nferrite and hard martensite for a \ufb01ner grain microstructure\nwhere higher fraction of ferrite\u2013martensite interfaces is\npresent. Thereafter, the lower stress concentration at fer-rite\u2013martensite interfaces led to more relaxation of strain\nand therefore the higher ductility. In addition, uniform\ndistribution of the martensite also resulted in lower stressconcentration and uniform strain distribution, delaying the\nplastic instability or necking of the material to higher\nstrains.\n3.3 Strain-Hardening Behavior\nA study by Colla et al. [ 37] showed that modi\ufb01ed C\u2013J\nanalysis based on Swift equation can describe the multi-\nstage strain-hardening behavior of dual-phase steel, which\nis based on the following equation:\ne\u00bce\n0\u00fekrm: \u00f03\u00de\nDifferentiating the previous equation with respect to e\nand expressing in logarithmic form is:\nln\u00f0dr=de\u00de\u00bc\u00f0 1/C0m\u00delnr/C0ln\u00f0km\u00de: \u00f04\u00dewhere randeare true stress and true strain, respectively,\nkis the constant which is normally called the strength\ncoef\ufb01cient, e0is the maximum elastic strain and (1 -m)i s\nthe slope. It can be seen that the strain-hardening abilitydecreases with increasing m. Corresponding to the stress\u2013\nstrain curves in Fig. 5, Fig. 6shows the plots of ln (d r/de)\nversus ln r. Using linear \ufb01tting, the 1/ mwas obtained and\nindicated in Fig. 6.\nThe plots of ln (d r/de) versus ln rclearly reveal two\ndistinct stages of strain hardening, which is related to dif-ferent deformation mechanisms. The \ufb01rst stage (stage I)\nwith the lower slope, representing higher strain-hardening\nability, is attributed to deformation of soft ferrite matrixalone assisted by mobile dislocations present near the\nmartensite regions. The second stage (stage II) with the\nhigher slope, corresponding to the lower strain-hardeningability, is attributed to uniform deformation of hard\nmartensite and already strain-hardened ferrite. Two stages\nof strain hardening by modi\ufb01ed C\u2013J technique have beendemonstrated earlier for DP steels [ 17,38].\nAs indicated in Fig. 6,1 /mdecreases in the order of\nIQ[IA[SQ, for either stage. Son et al. [ 39] and\nMazaheri et al. [ 40] reported a 4% volume expansion from\nthe martensitic transformation of the austenite, which led tothe creation of geometrically necessary dislocations\n(GNDs) along the ferrite\u2013martensite interfaces in the ferrite\ngrains. Then, a higher strain-hardening rate would beexpected from the higher fraction of ferrite\u2013martensite\ninterface. Besides, decreasing the size of martensite islands\nwould be favorable for achieving higher strain-hardeningrate in DP steels [ 41].\nFurthermore, martensite morphology also affects the\nstrain-hardening behavior in DP steels. According toMazinani and Poole [ 42], the martensite plasticity is\nfavored by changing the martensite island\u2019s morphology\nFig. 5 Engineering a, true stress\u2013strain bcurves of the investigated steelsY.-G.

    "page_6": "from equiaxed to band. In the present study, owing to the\nhigher plastic deformation ability of coarse and nearlybanded martensite particles (SQ sample), as compared to\n\ufb01ne and equiaxed martensite particles (IQ and IA samples),\nthe lower strain-hardening ability in the former rather thanin the latter would be expected. Higher strain-hardening\nrate delays the onset of necking and therefore increases\nuniform elongation and total elongation (Table 1).\n3.4 Fracture Mechanisms\nFigure 7shows the fractured surfaces of the heat-treated\nsamples, where dimples are observed in the IQ and IA\nsamples while cleavage fracture is also present in SQsample. It is known that the ductile fracture in DP steels\noccurs in three sequential stages, i.e., void nucleation, void\ngrowth and void coalescence, which resulted in the dim-pled fracture surface. Microvoids which nucleated at the\nferrite\u2013martensite interfaces usually grow within the more\nductile ferrite matrix. The difference in fracture mechanismcould be attributed to the morphology and distribution of\nthe martensite. For the banded and interconnected\nmartensite islands, compared to the \ufb01ne and isolatedmartensite islands, more cleavage facets would be gener-\nated [ 7,42]. The interconnected martensite, which locatedalong the ferrite grain boundaries, cracked easily and pre-\ndominantly resulted in the cleavage fracture mode. How-ever, martensite cracking was less frequent and the\nmicrovoids were smaller and microvoid density was higher\nin the specimen with \ufb01ne martensite particles, and thefracture formed was a dimple depression type.\nTo further elucidate the effect of the microstructures on\nductility, the cross-sectional area beneath the fracturedsurfaces was also analyzed as shown in Fig. 8.\nHigher density of voids appeared in the IQ and IA\nsamples (Fig. 8a, b) is noticeable, which have higher true\nstrains at fracture. In contrast, the microstructural damage\nin the form of voids is considerably less in the SQ sample\n(Fig. 8c) with a much lower fracture strain. These obser-\nvations are consistent with the earlier report [ 43]. In\naddition, the fracture surface for IQ and IA samples\nexhibited a vivid jagged edge as marked by red arrow inFig. 8, which stands for a longer path for void coalescence\nand therefore a higher elongation before fracture.\nIn order to reveal the preferred void nucleation sites, the\ncross-sectional area beneath the fracture surface was fur-\nther analyzed by SEM. As can be seen from Fig. 9, the\nfrequent nucleation of the microvoids at the fer-rite/martensite interfaces irrespective of the heat-treatment\nschedules (as marked by the black arrow) can be observed.\nFig. 6 Modi\ufb01ed C\u2013J plots of ln (d r/de) versus ln rfor ferrite\u2013martensite DP microstructures developed by varying heat-treatment paths: aIQ,\nbIA,cSQ\nFig. 7 SEM images on the fracture surfaces of IQ a,I A b,S Q c1146 Y.-G.

According to\nUggowitzer and Stu \u00a8we [ 44], the fractured martensite acts\nas a sharp notch, leading to cleavage crack in the ferrite. As\ncan be seen from Fig. 9b, the presence of microvoids\nwithin the ferrite grains for IA sample (as marked by the\nwhite arrow in Fig. 9b) allows one to infer that the ferrite\nphase is effectively restrained against plasticity by thesurrounding martensite in IA sample and this leads to\nhigher stress concentration during ferrite/martensite inter-\nfaces. As a consequence, the microvoids formed atmartensite/ferrite interfaces can easily grow along the\ninterface and promote the void coalescence resulting into\nlower values of the elongation to failure.

In addition, lower stress\nconcentration was expected due to uniform and \ufb01ne dis-tribution of the martensite in the IQ sample.\n4 Conclusions\n1. The microstructure of DP steels varied signi\ufb01cantly\nwith the heat-treatment schedule: IQ treatment pro-\nduced \ufb01ne and \ufb01brous martensite uniformly distributed\nin the ferrite matrix; IA treatment showed a network\nmartensite along the ferrite grain boundaries; SQ\ntreatment showed that the martensite reveals coarseblocky microstructure;\n2.
