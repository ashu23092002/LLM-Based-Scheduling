The bearing steels are \nworking under dynamic loads in service conditions and their toughness properties become important. In order to provide the de sired \nmechanical properties, various heat treatments ( austenizing , quenching  and tempering) are usually applied. In this study, AISI 52100 \nbearing steel samples were austenized  at 900\u00b0C for \u00bd h and water quenched to room temperature. Then tempering  was carried out at \n795\u00b0C, 400\u00b0C  and 200\u00b0C for \u00bd h. In order t o investigate the effect of heat treatment conditions on wear behavior , dry friction tests were \nperformed according to ASTM G99 -05 Standard  with a \u2018ball -on-disk\u2019 type tribometer. The samples were tested against steel and ceramic \ncounterparts using the para meters of 100 m distance and 30 N load and 0.063 m/s  rotational speed. After wear test,  the surface  \ncharacterization was carried out using microscopy. Wear loss values were calculated using a novel optical method on both flat and \ncounterpart specimens.  \n \nKeywords:  Wear resistant alloys , Bearing steel, Tribology, Microscopy , Characterization   \n \n \n \n1. Introduction  \n \nToday, the bearing steels are used as one of the key \ncomponents in design and manufacturing of various machinery \nparts. They must , therefore,  ensur e a series of requirements \nincluding wear and fatigue resistance under rolling/sliding \ncontacts, axial loadings and crack propagation and growth, as well \nas high or adequate hardness, strength, toughness, ductility and \nlast but not least , corrosion resista nce [1-5].  \nAlloy compositions including carbon amount between 0.8 -1.1 \nwt-% and substitutional solute elements amount up to 3.0 wt -% \nare commonly chosen for bearing applications. The matrices of \nthese groups of steel alloys are preferably transformed to martensite after quenching in suitable media , e.g. oil or salt. Due \nto the relatively high alloy elements and carbon content, \nmartensitic matrices need to be tempered to suppress the excess \nbrittleness. Hardenability depth is another important key factor, \nparticularly for those steel parts, which possess relatively large \ncross -sectional area. When this depth value is not sufficient at \ngiven dimensions of bearing steel part, the case hardening \ntreatment or increasing alloy content can be introduced [1,3].  \nThe spheroidization  treatment plays a critical role in  the \nmanufacturing  process of this sort of hypereutectoid steels. \nBecause proeutectoid  cementite can easily be formed at prior \naustenite grain boundaries on cooling, and hence resulting an \ninappropriate mi crostructure in terms of rolling contact  resistance. \nThe spheroidization treatment before machining and hardening \nUnauthenticated\nDownload Date | 10/5/17 2:46 PM",

There was a lack \nof harder counterpart condition in dry sliding contact pairs in \nthose studies. In this study, bearing steels heat treated in various \nconditions were tribologically tested in dry sliding against \nalumi na and 100Cr6 counterpart .  \nThe main purpose of this study was to evaluate heat  treated \nbearing steels in wear test against harder ceramic counterparts to \nsee if there are any difference between them in terms of wear \nresistance under the tribological loading, which is mainly driven \nby abrasive wear mechanism rather than adhesive one that \ncompared in previous studies [8 -9]. A recently published novel \nmethod [11 -12] enables to obtain profilometric measurements on \nwear track with precise volumetric wear loss values calculating \nfrom the  math formulae based on the  track profile geometry \nformed during  the wear test.  \n \n \n2. Experimental  \n \n2.1. Heat treatment  and surface preparation  \n \nThe working material in the experimental  study, Fe -0.95C -\n0.21Si -0.36Mn -1.44Cr is a well -known AISI 52100 grade alloy \nand commonly used as bearing steel in wide vari ety applications. \nThe delivered specimens from a local supplier cut up into slices \nhad dimensions of 12 -15 mm in height and 40 mm.  \nThe austenization  treatment at 900\u00b0C for \u00bd h was applied to \nall specimens, followed by water quenching to room temperature \n(RT) without cracking in their structures, whose dimensions could \ncompensate this sort of supercooling. The specimens were split \ninto three groups in which they were heat treated with various \nparameters as listed in Table 1. The specimens were then polished  \nand etched for microscopic investigation. Nital  (vol.% -3) was \nused as  the etchant . Their hardness values were measured on \nmetallographically prepared surfaces using Vickers method under \na load of 10 kg -f.  \nThe g roup of G1 specimens was heat treated to obt ain a \nspheroidized  cementite structure very finely distributed in  the \nferritic  matrix instead of regular pearlitic formation  (see Fig. 1) . \nFor this purpose, they were tempered or let\u2019s say austenized  at \n795\u00b0C for \u00bd h and then furnace temperature set to 680 \u00b0C with a \ncooling rate of 370 K/h. The second leg of cooling was continued \nin the furnace  with the self-cooling  condition to RT.  This group \nhas the lowest  hardness and is however used as reference \nmaterials for the calculation of math equations.   The g roup of G2 specimens was tempered at 400\u00b0C and their \nmicrostructures consist of typical tempered martensite structure \n(Fig. 2).  The backscattered electron imaging with compositional \nmode (BEI/C) in Fig. 2 reveals the randomly oriented patches of \ntempered marte nsite structure with a distributed carbide grains in \ndark contrast.   \nThe g roup of G3 specimen showed slightly tempered and \nstress relieved martensitic matrix with some additions of retained \naustenite in its microstructural investigation, due to relatively \nlower tempering temperature (200\u00b0C), as seen in BEI/C mode \nscanning electron micro scope  (SEM) image (see Fig. 3 ).  \n \n \nFig. 1.

Wear test and characterization  \n \nFor wear characterization, \u201cball -on-disk\u201d type sliding test in \ndry condition according to ASTM G99 -05 Standard  [10] were \ncarried out using a tribometer from Nanovea. Apart  from previous \nstudies [8 - 9], two variants as counterpart were used against flat \nAISI 52100 bearing steel specimens. These counterparts a re pure \nalumina and DIN 100Cr6 ( equivalent to AISI 52100) steel balls. \nRelated details for the dry sliding test are  listed i n Table 2. The \nflat specimens were tested in dry sliding condition afterward  \nmetallographic  preparation procedures and cleaned with acetone. \nAfter the tribological test, the worn surfaces of both flat bearing \nsteel specimens and the ball-shaped  counterpart s were examined \nin the optical  microscope and their worn volumes were calculated \nusing novel optical profilometric techniques as described in \nprevious studies [11 -12].  \n \n \n3. Results and Discussion  \n \nThe change in coefficient of friction (COF) values with \nsliding distance during tests were presented in Fig. 4. Sliding pairs \nof various bearing steel specimens against 100Cr6 counterpart \nballs (Fig. 4a) yielded slightly different friction levels in first half \nof the total sliding distance, but almost same at the  second part of \nit. Their kinematic COF values were about 0.25 in steady state \ncondition. Their frictional behavio r against alumina ceramic \ncounterpart balls resembles previous ones but the average COF \nvalues yielded around 0.20 in steady state condition. In both \ncases, G2 specimens yielded lower COF values than that of \nothers, particularly at the first half of the test distance.  \nAs stated before, the sliding surfaces were cleaned at the \nbeginning. That means the counterpart ball slides on a very \nsmooth fla t specimen surface at the initial period of wear test. \nHowever, the maximum Hertzian contact pressure values for test \npairs under given tribological test conditions, point out that the \ndry sliding test starts with a plastic deformation on flat specimen \nsurfaces . For example , G1, G2 or G3  specimen s against 100Cr6 , \nsuffer from a maximum Hertzian contact pressure  level of 2238.5 \nMPa , while having a shear stress  level of 694 MPa  under 38 \u00b5m \ndepth of their original surface s, according to the calculated \nresults . On the other hand , same specimens against alumina \ncounterpart balls  are exposed to a maximum Hertzian contact pressure level of 2341.7 MPa , while having a shear stress level of \n726 MPa  under 38 \u00b5m depth of their original surface.   \n \nFig. 3. Etched microstr ucture of G3 specimen in SEM (BEI/C \nmode) shows mainly martensitic structure with some retained \naustenite revealed in light gray contrast between wedge type \nmartensite plates  \n \nThere is obviously elastopla stic contact between test pairs in \nall conditions. Briefly, the hard and spherical counterpart (the \nball) indents the relatively soft and flat specimen surface at the \nbeginning and then it is forced to slide. It turns into predominantly \nabrasive wear [14] under these circumstances. Since the G1 \nspecimen has  relatively lower hardness  and hence a better  \ndeformation capability , the micro -ploughing (Fig. 5) plays a \ncritical role in this case both against hard steel and ceramic \ncounterpart balls. G1 specimen s should, therefore,  have relatively \ndeeper indentation effect on its surface ; that leads to higher \nfriction and COF values,  at least during running -in period.  Its \nCOF value against 100Cr6 counterpart yielded relatively higher \nthan that of against ceramic one. Another wear mechanism, \nadhesion may play a critica l role here. Metal -metal pairs should \nhave much more tendency to cold welding at given conditions, \nthan that of metal -ceramic pairs. Likewise , cold welding \npossibility in the latter case must be minimum due to their \ndifferent material properties including bond structure, chemical \nstability etc. After  a running -in period, micro -cutting and work \nhardening  effect should be effective in G1 specimen -counterpart \npairs. That yields a slight decrease in COF values as seen in Fig. \n4a and b.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnauthenticated\nDownload Date | 10/5/17 2:46 PM",

Coefficient of friction \u2013 total sliding distance diagrams, \nbearing steel flat specimens against 100 Cr6 (a), and against \nalumina balls (b)  \n \nDue to its moderate hardness and microstructure of tempered \nmartensite, G2 specimens do not plastically deform  as much as \nG1 specimens at the running -in period. When the inherent oxide \nfilm on both sliding pairs was broken and cleaned, the two/three \nbody abrasion should be effective as predominant wear \nmechanism. Micro -cutting and work hardening effects play an \nimportant role in this period. The spalling  of partly oxidized \ndebris parts , as well as work hardened and pa rtly micro -cracked \nregions from flat specimen surface,  are responsible for the wear  \nlosses in the steady -state period.  The G3 specimen was relatively hardest among others. \nTherefore, they should be more brittle and less plastically \ndeformable  than others should. This may lead to a wear \nmechanism with the mixture of micro -cutting and micro -cracking, \nmore or less in  the running -in period. When it is covered with \npartly oxidized debris, the surface should have a protective layer \nand hence not increase anymore  through the steady -state period.  \nThe counterpart materials effect on tribological response can \nbe outlined that they did not change the tribological conditions \nfundamentally, but probably amended the weight ratio between \nmixed mechanisms, e.g. adhesive w ear in the pairs of metal -\nceramic counterparts should be less effective than that of metal -\nmetal ones, thus leading to a decrease in COF values in dry \nsliding tests.  \nThe tribological test results calculated from direct \nmicroscopic measurements were listed  in Table 3. COF values \nwere calculated as average values from sliding test result tables. \nVolume loss values were determined from cross -sectional profiles \nfor each specimen. The selected wear track  profiles measured \nusing optical microscope is given in Fi g. 5.  The width level of \nwear tracks belongs to metal -ceramic pairs seem to be wider than \nthat of metal -metal pairs. It must be noted that ceramic \ncounterpart balls have  a bigger  diameter  (see Table 2 ). Equally \nspaced six cross -sectional profiles for every  wear track were \nmeasured and used for calculation of worn volume loss values as \nrequired by the ASTM standard G99 -05 [10]. Although there \nwere important amount of wear on flat specimens, which are not \npresumed in related math formulae  described by ASTM G9 9-05 \nStandard , the worn volume in counterpart balls were still \ncalculated by the se formulae, since it has been shown  in a \nprevious study  [12] that the calculation error in this condition is \nless than 5% , generally . It must be noted that \u201cthe pil ing-up\u201d \nformation (or so -called micro -ploughing effect) on both sides of \nworn track profile could also be easily defined  if there any . This \npiling-up formation [13 -14] implies that there is plastic \ndeformation during indentation of the counterpart ball tip into to \nflat specimen surface.  \nThe most wear resistance was obtained in G3 specimens as \nexpected and as found in a previous  study [9], in which the \nvolume loss values were determined using a different method. G2 \nspecimens yielded lower wear resistance than G3 again st both \ncounterpart types, but the difference between them is quite small \nand additionally wear loss in counterpart is much more \nadvantageous in G2 specimens vs. steel/ceramic ball pairs, than \nthose with G3 specimens, in all circumstances. Likewise, the CO F \nvalues are also relatively lower in G2 specimens particularly at \nfirst half of the sliding tests (see Fig. 4). It implies that dry sliding \nbetween G2 and counterpart pairs brings much more \nadvantageous lower friction during first 40 -50 m of total distanc e, \nbut eventually the worn debris formed covers throughout the \nUnauthenticated\nDownload Date | 10/5/17 2:46 PM",

Conclusions  \n \nAISI 52100 is a well -known bearing s teel and used frequently \nwear resistant alloy needed applications, where hardness, wear \nresistance, fatigue resistance, last but not least toughness are \ndemanded. Spheroidization treatment is a key step in \nmanufacturing this group of alloys before hardenin g and \ntempering in order to eliminate secondary carbide network at \nprior austenite grain boundaries and hence to increase wear \nresistance. Hardening through a martensitic matrix in \nmicrostructure is one of the methods to obtain a wear resistant \nsteel struc ture but its lack of toughness is a major  shortcoming in \nthese group of steel alloys. There are plenty of studies indicating \nthe advantageous use of bainitic or tempered martensitic \nstructures in wear resistant applications [1,8 -9].  \nIn this study,  metal -metal and metal -ceramic interactions in \ndry sliding pairs were examined and their interrelations and \nequations determined with high determination coefficients. \nAccording to results obtained, the foll owing conclusions were \noutlined:  \n\u2022 Wear mechanisms were char acterized as a mixture  of \nabrasive, adhesive and tribo -corrosion types on all worn \nsurfaces. However, abrasive wear is predominant one \namong them. Micro -ploughing and micro -cutting induced \ntrack formation in friction directions are evident for \nabrasive wea r, while smeared and then partly spalled  debris \nlayers for adhesive and tribo -corrosion wear .  \n\u2022 The change in counterpart material from steel to ceramic did \nnot affect wear phenomenon on flat specimen surfaces \nfundamentally. According to results, there were  differences \nin the amount  of volume loss, contact area,  the ratio of \nadhesive wear mechanism in total wear behavior , etc. But \nthe predominant mechanism was abrasion in both \ncounterpart types.  \n\u2022 G3 specimens yielded best wear resistance in given \ntribologica l conditions, but their counterparts worn  at most \nin comparison with other counterparts.  \n\u2022 G2 specimens showed quite close performance in wear \nresistance to G3 specimens, moreover,  their counterparts \nshowed equal or lesser to that of G1 specimens, which had  a \nquite  soft structure for machining purposes.  \nUnauthenticated\nDownload Date | 10/5/17 2:46 PM",
