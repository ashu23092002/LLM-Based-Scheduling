Introduction\nSAE 52100  is  an  alloy  steel  with  high  carbon  with  chromium\nas  an  alloying  element,  which  has  been  widely  applied  in\nrolling bearings  [1].  The  traditional  heat  treatment  process  for\nSAE  52100  steel  consists  of  a  quenching  process  followed  by\na tempering  step  at  low  temperature.  The  resulting  tempered\nmartensite  microstructure  provides  SAE  52100  steel  with  high\nstrength  and  high  fatigue  resistance  [2].\nAn isothermal  heat  treatment  process  has  been  suggested\nas  an  alternative  process  to  produce  bainite  microstructure\nin  order  to  provide  excellent  mechanical  properties  includ-\ning high  toughness,  strength  and  wear  resistance  [3,4] .

Wang).bainite  microstructure  can  be  classi\ufb01ed  into  upper  and  lower\nbainite  in  terms  of  the  carbide  precipitation.  In  upper  bai-\nnite, most  of  the  carbide  is  present  within  the  interface\nbetween  ferritic  sheaves.  In  lower  bainite,  most  of  the  car-\nbide is  formed  inside  the  ferritic  platelets  without  any  carbon\ntransfer [5\u20137] .\nKrishna  et  al.  [8]  investigated  the  impact  toughness  and\nwear  resistance  of  austempered  SAE  52100  steel  produced  at\nan austempering  temperature  of  340\u25e6C  with  holding  dura-\ntions  of  10  min,  20  min  and  30  min.  They  found  that  the\nimpact toughness  of  austempered  SAE  52100  steel  specimens\nincreased  when  they  extended  the  holding  duration  due  to\nthe  presence  of  more  bainitic  structure  in  the  matrix.  In  their\nabrasion wear  test,  the  wear  loss  of  austempered  specimens\nwas  much  lower  than  that  of  annealed  specimens.  Kar  et  al.\n[9] applied  a  two-cycle  austenitizing  process  (1st  austenitizing\nstep: 1150\u25e6C,  60  min;  2nd  austenitizing  step:  900\u25e6C,  20  min)\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmrt.2019.08.001\n2238-7854/\u00a9  2019  The  Authors.

Kilicli  et  al.  [10]  demonstrated  that  varying  austem-\npering temperature was  more  effective  than  varying  holding\ntime in  isothermal  heat  treatment  on  the  fraction  of  bainite\nproduced  in  SAE  52100  steel.  Bainite  +  martensite  microstruc-\nture was  found  to  yield  high  levels  of  hardness  (55\u201364  HRC)\nand  enhanced  impact  toughness  (24\u201354  Joule).  Sari  et  al.  [11]\nfound that nitrogen and  carbon  dioxide  ion  implantation\ncould be  used  to  modify  the  mechanical  properties  of  a  wide\nrange of  metals  and  alloys  using  plasma  techniques  for  ion\nsources  and  plasma  surface  treatment.  The  hardness  of  SAE\n52100  samples  could  be  increased  30\u201349%  using  N  +  2  ions,\nand 5\u201317%  using  co2+  ions.  Chakraborty  et  al.  [12]  found  that\nan optimum  austempering  process  (270\u25e6C,  30  min)  followed\nby water quenching can  develop  a  bainite  +  martensite  duplex\nmicrostructure\n and  improved  levels  of  hardness  (62HRC)  and\ntensile (2250  MPa)  and  impact  strength  (53  J).\nIn the  past  two  decades,  researchers  have  investigated\nthe  mechanical  properties  of  austempered  SAE  52100  steel.\nHowever, few  researchers  thoroughly  studied  the  formation\nand morphological  transformation  of  bainitic  structure  in  the\nmatrix  of  SAE  52100.  In  this  study,  eight  austempering  tem-\nperatures and  twenty-three  holding  times  were  utilized  for\ndetailed  analysis.  The  Rockwell  hardness  and  microstructure\nwere  studied  using  a  hardness  tester  and  optical  microscopy.\nAlso, the  transformation  kinetics  of  bainitic  formation  are\ncharacterized  in  this  research.\n2.

Then,  the  mounted  specimens  were  etched  using\n3% nital solution  for  approximately  2  s  to  3  s.  Finally,  optical\nmicroscopy  was  used  to  observe  the  microstructure  of  the  SAE\n52100 specimens.\n3.  Results  and  discussion\n3.1. Rockwell  C  hardness  measurement\nThe  hardness  measurements  of  austempered  SAE  52100  steel\nspecimens produced by  various  austempering  temperatures\nand  holding  times  are  plotted  in  Fig.  3.  For  all  austem-\npering  temperatures,  it  was  found  that  the  hardness  drops\nover a  certain  period  and  then  gradually  becomes  \ufb02at.  The\nholding  times  when  the  hardness  starts  to  drop  and  then\nremains  \ufb02at  are  de\ufb01ned  as  the  beginning  and  ending  points\nof the  bainitic  transformation  reaction  from  austenite.  The\nbeginning  point  of  bainitic  transformation  begins  earlier  withincreasing  austempering  temperature.  In  addition,  the  slope\nof the  transition  period  became  larger  at  higher  austemper-\ning temperature.  This  is  because  the  rate  of  carbon  diffusion\nis  accelerated  at  high  austempering  temperature.  The  rate  of\nthe transformation  reaction  was  also  accelerated  by  faster  dif-\nfusion  of  carbon  at  high  temperature.\n3.2.  Morphological  analysis  of  bainite\nThe microstructures of  austempered  SAE  52100  steel  speci-\nmens  produced  by  various  austempering  temperatures  and\nholding  times  are  shown  in  Fig.  4.  The  main  components  in\nthe matrix  are  bainite  (black  regions),  martensite  (dark  brown\nregions)  and  retained  austenite  (light-colored  regions).  The\namount  of  bainite  increases  signi\ufb01cantly  when  using  longer\nholding times. Eventually,  the  matrix  becomes  100%  bainite.\nThe  bainite  platelets  become  coarse  at  higher  austemper-\ning  temperatures.  The  bainite  produced  when  using  lower\naustempering temperatures  between  232\u25e6C  and  316\u25e6C  con-\nsists  of  narrow  needle-like  ferrite  sheaves.  However,  the\nbainite  formed  at  higher  austempering  temperatures  of  372\u25e6C\nand 427\u25e6C  are  considered  as  upper  bainite  due  to  formation  of\nbainitic  islands  in  the  matrix.  Both  upper  and  lower  bainite  are",

Several\nconclusions  can  be  summarized  as  follows:\n1 Lower  bainite  was  produced  using  austempering  temper-\natures  ranging  from  232\u25e6C  (450\u25e6F)  to  343\u25e6C  (600\u25e6F).  The\nferrite platelets  became  coarse  and  upper  bainite  was  pro-\nduced whe  n  using  the  austempering  temperatures  of  372\u25e6C\n(700\u25e6F)  and  427\u25e6C  (800\u25e6F).",
