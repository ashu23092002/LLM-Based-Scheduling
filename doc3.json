Heat \ntreatment is one such process that commonly enhances the properties of steel.  The previous \nresearchers have concentrated mainly on austempering and Martempering of AISI steels. \nHowever to t he best of authors\u2019 knowledge no work has yet been conducted on the tempering \nof AISI 52100 alloy steel.  Thus the present research endeavor is one such attempt  to study \nthe effect of heat treatment on the mechanical properties of AISI 52100 alloy steel. D ifferent \ntests like compression, hardness, impact and wear have been carried out after the tempering at \n250\u02daC, 350\u02daC, 450\u02daC and 550\u02daC respectively.  The tests are conducted as per ASTM \nstandards.  It is observed that the as -received AISI samples possess high  carbide content \nwhich makes them hard, whereas the tempering reduces the carbide content indicating less \nhardness. The impact tests revealed that the impact strength of the tempered samples \nincreased when compared to the as -received specimens. Moreover,  approximately 50 \u201360% \nwear resistance was improved with tempering of AISI steel . However,  the elasticity and \nDuctility values showed a decreasing -increasing trend which is typical of tool steels of this \nclass. The applications of AISI 52100 steel include bearing manufacture, ball screws, and \ngauges. Based on the functional requirement, the choice can be made among the tempered \nAISI 52100 steels.  \n \nKeywords : AISI steel, tempering, compression, hardness, impact, wear.  \n \n1. INTRODUCTION  \n Steels can be subjected to  variety of conventional heat treatments like normalizing, \nhardening and tempering. Th e knowledge of materials and their properties is of great \nimportance for a production engineer. The machine elements should be endowed with \nmaterials that possess propert ies suitable for withstanding different operating conditions.  For \nexample, AISI 52100 is a high carbon alloy steel which achieves a high degree of hardness \nwith compressive strength and abrasion resistance used in ball and roller bearings, spinning ",
    "page_3": "tools, punch and dies. In such cases, to bring about the required properties heat treatment \nmethods are commonly used. The combined effect of heating and cooling operations \nperformed in a metal or alloy in the solid state is termed as heat treatment. The high \ntemperature austenite phase possesses a unique property to transform into diversified room \ntemperature phases like coarse pearlite, martensite, and bainite depending upon cooling cycle \n[1-3]. These phases possibly are decomposition products like ferrite & cem entite or may be \nsuper saturated solid solutions. The factors such as plate thickness and interlammer spacing \nbetween ferrite and cementite phases in pearlite, greatly influence property and performance \nof steels. In case of the plate thickness and interla mmer spacing between ferrite and cementite \nbeing large; coarser will be the pearlite and ferrite, thereby increasing ductility. This is \nattainable by slow cooling of the austenitic phase to room temperature, accordingly the \ntreatment is known as annealing [4-7].  If the austenitic phase is cooled at a slightly faster \nrate, the decomposition of austenite by the eutectoid reaction will be available to form finer \npearlite with increase in weight percentage of eutectoid mixture (pearlite), this kind of \ntreatmen t is known as normalizing [8 -11]. Here the degree of dispersion of ferrite and \ncementite in pearlite increases to improve the machinability with finer grain size. The \nnormalized steel contains nearly 50 wt % of pearlite and 50 wt % of proeutectoid ferrite.  If \nthe austenitic phase is cooled in such a way that the cooling rate is greater than or equal to \ncritical cooling rate (CCR), the transformed phase is termed as martensite. It is supersaturated \nsingle phase with body centered tetragonal (BCT) structure. The BCT structure has got a c/a \nratio higher with more trapped carbon in the lattice. Thus there is increase in hardness and \nstrength with considerable amount of thermal stresses because of quenching severity. To \ndecrease the c/a ratio of BCT martensite, t o improve toughness, to convert retained austenite \ninto stable phases; to saturate the non -equilibrium BCT martensitic structure and to minimize \nthe thermal stresses induced during hardening, tempering treatment is given. Depending upon \nthe tempering tempe rature and duration, the improvement in toughness is achievable with the \nsacrifice of hardness and strength. Because of high brittleness, as quenched spring steels are \nseldom used for practical applications [12, 13]. By tempering process, the properties of  \nquenched steel could be modified to improve its impact resistance. Amid tempering, the \nresulting microstructure contains bainite or epsilon carbide in a matrix of ferrite depending on \nthe tempering temperature.   \nMandal et al. [12] investigated the in fluence of austempering on the mechanical \nproperties and microstructure of silicon alloyed cast steel. The experimental results showed ",
    "page_4": "that, ausferrite structure consisting of bainitic ferrite and austenite could be retained by \naustempering the steel for dif ferent austempering temperature. MacIejewski and Regulski \n[13] conducted studies on the fracture assessment of martempered, quenched and tempered \nAISI 4140 low alloy steel. It was concluded that the  advantages of Martempering  include less \ndistortion, elimi nation of cracking, improved fatigue, and improved impact energy. Lerner \nand Kingsbury [14] conducted dry sliding and abrasive wear experiments on Austempered \nDuctile Iron (ADI) in order to examine the potential applications of this material for wear \nparts , as an alternative to steels and other competitive materials. It was observed that ADI \npossessed excellent wear properties, combined with their relatively low -friction coefficient \nand could be potentially used for dry sliding wear applications. In abrasiv e wear mode, the \nwear rate of ADI was comparable to that of alloyed hardened AISI 4340 steel, and relatively \none-half that of hardened medium carbon AISI 1050 steel. Jetley [15] reported improvement \nin tribological characters of aircra ft brake steel rotors  by Martempering. Martempering \nprocess was done by oil - and water -based quench ants at lower temperature. The samples \nwere tested for hardness, distortion, and wear. The results showed that both hardness and \nwear resistances were lower when compared to the  austempering, and also met the design \nintent. However, to the best of the authors\u2019 observations, there have been few reports on \ntempering behavior of AISI 52100. The objective of the present study is to investigate the \neffect of the tempering on the micro structure and mechanical properties of AISI 52100, \nproviding reference for its various industrial applications.  \n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS  \nThe chemical composition of medium carbon steel samples used for this investigation is \ngiven in the following Table 1.  \n2.1 Test specimen preparation  \nThe material used for this study is AISI 52100 possessing a carbon content of about 1.10% \ncarbon. The specimens were then prepared for a compression tests for finding out various \nparameters such as percentage reduction in length and Modulus of Elasticity using a standard \nformat of ASTM. The tests were carried out by a Universal testing machine using prepared \nspecimens.  \n2.2 Heat treating the medium carbon steel  \nStandard heat treatment procedures were adapted to heat treat the AISI stee l. Five different \nsamples were prepared for each operation and the average values were calculated based on \nthe analysis made . ",
    "page_5": "2.3 Hardening Process  \nThe specimens to be hardened were placed inside the furnace and heated to a temperature of \n9000C. The samples we re retained at this temperature for a period of one hour (because of its \nmass) during which the transformation must have been completed. Hardening operation was \ncarried out on five steel samples having the same dimensions.  \nTable 1 - Chemical composition of AISI 52100 . \n \n2.3 Tempering Process   \nTempering consists of reheating of the quenched steel to a suitable temperature which is \nbelow the transformation temperature for a considerable amount of time and then cooling \nback to room temperature. This process permits microstructure modifications for reducing \nhardness to a desired level thereby increasing its ductili ty. Tempering results in a desired \ncombination of ductility, hardness, toughness, strength and structural stability. The desired \nproperties and structures depend on tempering temperature and time. Tempering of the \nquenched specimens was carried out in a mu ffle furnace for about one hour. Experimental \nheat treatment cycles for selective alloy is hardening and followed by tempering are done at \n2500C increased by 1000C to 5500C for each tempering time interval.  \n \n2.4 Mechanical test  \nAfter these treatments, mechanical properties of the specimens were examined i.e. hardness, \ncompressive strength, Impact and wear test and percentage of elongation.  \n \n2.6 Compression test specimen  \nThe compression test specimens were prepared as per ASTM C39 standards.

Load -elongation data were recorded and converted  into stress -\nstrain graphs. Material properties such as % reduction in length, Young\u2019s Modulus (E) have \nbeen determined.

    "page_8": "9000C and tempered at different tempering temperature 2500C to 5500C. The data clearly \nshows a decrease in hardness with increase in tempering temperature. V ariation of hardness \nagainst tempering temperature for each heat treatment sequence is shown in Figure 5. As \ntempering temperature increases, hardness then gradually decreases. It has been a general \nobservation for steels that hardness decreases with highe r tempering temperatures. However, \nthe increasing -decreasing trend seen here for AISI 52100 steel is in line with typical behavior \nof high -strength hot -work tool steels, especially H -category steels [16]. For all the cases the \nhardness values are quite clo se to each other, indicating that difference in heat treatment \nsequence does not have a significant effect on hardness.  The decrease in hardness is due to \ndecrease in c/a ratio of martensite during tempering. The marginal decrease in hardness \nshows the ina dequate tempering duration which is 1 hour. This is due to the relaxation of the \nBCT martensitic cell i.e. the drastic reduction in c/a ratio of martensite. Figure 6 shows that \nwith an increase in tempering temperature, impact toughness increases. The maxi mum value \nfor impact toughness was observed at tempering temperature of 550 0C which construes the \nfact that high tempering  temperatures play a dominant role in behavior of impact toughness \nwhile compared to lower tempering temperatures. Th e average wear v olume loss of heat \ntreated samples with respect to time in dry sliding test is presented in Figure 7. The bar graph \nclearly indicates that as the tempering temperature increases, the wear volume loss gradually \ndecreases. The as-received specimen had consid erable amount of burr formation at the end \nwhich was kept on the tungsten disc. This indicates that a lot of heat was formed at the end \nwhich deformed the portion of that end plastically. Also this suggests that the material was \nmore ductile than that of t he remaining samples.  Graphs portraying the variation of ductility \n(represented here as percent reduction) against tempering temperature for each heat treatment \nsequence are shown in Figure 8.  The Ductility suddenly increases as tempering temperature \nincre ases up to 2500C, and then starts to decrease rather sharply at 3500 C. This decreasing - \nincreasing trend of ductility variation is typical of steels of this class. A huge difference exists \nbetween the ductility values for as -received and 2500C tempered specimen. Even though a \nhuge difference is existing in these values for as -bought, tempered specimens, the fracture \nbehavior of hardened specimen is totally different [17, 18]. This is the evidence for the \nformation of brittle supersaturated sol id solution of martensite. This also justifies that the as -\nbought specimen is hot worked. This increase in ductility is due to the increase in weight % \nof pro -eutectoid ferrite which is coarse in size.  Figure 9 shows the variation of Modulus of \nelasticity (E) against tempering temperature. It is interesting to note that Elasticity first \nincreases (for 2500C), then decreases (from 2500C to 3500C) and then gradually increase for ",
