Impact wear, resulting from large fall heights,is determined by surface hardness, spalling tendency andresistance to breakage under the impact of the grindingmedia.\nThe hardness of the grinding media is a determining pa-\nrameterinthemateriallossesduetodrywear,abrasion,anditalsoshiftsthepotentiodynamicpolarizationcurves,resultinginadifferentcorrosionpotentialandcorrespondingcorrosionrate[16].

Materials and heat treatment\nThematerialusedinthisinvestigationwasanAISI52100\nbearing steel. This was chosen to represent the high carbon,low alloy steels being used in the commercial grinding in-dustries.Thechemicalcomposition(wt.%)was1.05C,1.70Cr, 0.34 Mn, 0.06 Mo, 0.18 Ni, 0.26 Si, 0.12 Cu, 0.016 S,balance Fe.\nAll the specimens for erosion, corrosion and electro-\nchemical testing were in the form of plates with dimen-sions: 50mm length, 25mm width and 2mm thickness.The specimens were polished using SiC abrasive papers,#180 to #600 grit, before they were subjected to heat treat-ment, erosion\u2013corrosion testing and electrochemical mea-surements.\nThe heat treatments included annealing, quenching and\ntempering. The annealing was carried out by holding for 1hat 750\n\u25e6C, and then furnace cooling to room temperature.\nThe quenching treatment was performed by holding for onehourat900\n\u25e6C,thenquenchingtheheatedsamplesintowater.\nTempering was carried out on the quenched specimens for10h at 650\n\u25e6C[17].\nAfter the heat treated specimens were removed from the\nfurnace or quenching media, the outer layer of loose oxidewas mechanically removed using a plastic plate. The spec-imens were then immersed in a hydrochloric acid solutioncontaining 50% HCl (36%) and 50% water [18], and stirred\nusingaglassrodtoelectrochemicallydissolvetheinnerlayerofoxide.Thespecimenswerethoroughlyrinsedusingtapwa-terinordertoremoveanyacidresidueonthesurface,andthencompletely dried to avoid further corrosion. The specimenswith a clean and active surface were then ready for the ero-sion, corrosion and electrochemical measurements/testing.\n2.2. Erosion testing\nDry erosion was conducted in a custom-made erosion\ntester with SiC particles as the erodent. The SiC particleswere accelerated with pressurized air in a long horizontaltube. The erosion angle was set at 45\n\u25e6and the total erosion\nweights were 10, 50 and 100g of SiC particles [16].\n2.3. Electrochemical measurements\nThe electrochemical measurements were conducted in a\ntri-electrode cell with a saturated calomel electrode (SCE)as the reference electrode (RE) and a graphite plate asthe counter electrode (CE). Electrochemical measurementswere carried out in 2g/l NaCl and 2g/l Na\n2SO4solu-\ntions to simulate the chemical composition of practical oregrinding process solutions (adjusted to neutral pH) on both\neroded and uneroded specimens using a Solartron 1285\npotentiostat.\nThe measured electrochemical parameters included the\nopen-circuit potential, polarization resistance ( Rp), corro-\nsion potential, Tafel slopes ( \u03b2aand\u03b2c), corrosion rate, lin-\near polarization curves and Tafel potentiodynamic polariza-tioncurves.Basedontheelectrochemicalparametersandthestrainenergy,asynergisticeffectbetweenerosionandcorro-sion was evaluated.\n2.4. Measurements of the microstrain induced by\nerosion of heat-treated 52100 steel\nXRD analysis was used to characterize the microstrain\ninduced by the impact of SiC particles. The correspondingstored strain energy can be calculated from this microstrainand the synergistic effect correlating strain energy and elec-trochemical potential can be characterized. A Phillips X-raydiffractometerwithaproportionalcounterdetectionheadwasused.GraphitemonochromatedCuk /H9251radiation,atavoltage\nof40kVandacurrentof20mA,wasutilizedasthediffract-ing medium.\nThe AISI 52100 steel was \ufb01rst fully annealed in order\nto determine the instrumental broadening (all the broaden-ing of the diffraction peaks for an fully annealed specimenis assumed to be only from instrumental effects). The scan-ning angles (2 \u03b8) were from 30 to 150\n\u25e6at a scanning step\nof 0.5\u25e6. A XRD pattern of intensity versus 2 \u03b8was obtained.\nThere were six peaks recorded for each heat-treated spec-imen and the peak positions were determined. Then, theheat-treated and eroded specimens were scanned again ata scanning rate of 0.02\n\u25e6in a small angular range around\nthe six peaks to determine the broadening of the XRDpeaks.\nFrom the broadening of the XRD peaks, the microstrain\ndue to erosion can be calculated [18,19]. The broadening is\ndetermined by measuring the width B, in radians, at an in-\ntensity equal to half the maximum intensity.

The annealed samples\nhave the lowest value of polarization resistance, indicatingthe possible highest corrosion rate. Generally speaking, thetempered samples have the highest polarization resistance(exceptfortheunerodedsamples,whichhasaslightlylowervalue than the quenched sample), indicating the lowest cor-rosion rate for the tempered specimen. Thus it is concludedthatatemperingheattreatmentismuchbetterthanastraightquenching treatment and is recommended from the view-point of corrosion, even though the quenched sample has averyhighhardness( Table1),whichisindicativeofimproved\nwearresistance.Inthegrindingindustry,wherewetgrindingisthemostcommonlyusedmethod,bothcorrosionandwearresistance should be considered in material selection.\nTo further understand the effect of heat-treatment on\nthe electrochemical behavior of eroded 52100 steel, thepolarization behavior was investigated using a potentiody-\nTable 1\nHardness of the heat-treated AISI 52100 steel specimens\nHardness (HRc)\nAnnealed 14Quenched 66Quenched and tempered 45namic polarization method with a potential scanning rate of\n10mV/min [21].Fig.3a\u2013dshowtheeffectofheat-treatment\nonthepotentiodynamicpolarizationcurvesfortheun-eroded,and the eroded samples with 10, 50 and 100g SiC particles,respectively. Heat-treatment changes both the shape and theposition of the curves, indicating that both the corrosion po-tentialandthecorrosionreactionkinetics(Tafelslopes \u03b2\naand\n\u03b2c) have changed. Fig. 4shows the effect of heat treatment\nonthecorrosionpotential.Generallyspeaking,theannealedsample has the lowest negative potential, re\ufb02ecting a highelectrochemical activity. At a lower erosion level (10g), thetemperedsamplehasamorenegativecorrosionpotentialthanthe quenched sample, but at higher levels of erosion (50g),the tempered sample has a higher potential. In practical, i.e.commercial, grinding, the grinding media are subjected torepeated erosion and collision, and the amount of particlesis signi\ufb01cantly larger than 100g. According to the trend incorrosion potential as shown in Fig. 4, the tempered sample\nwill have the highest corrosion potential on further erosion,indicating that it is the least prone to corrosion. Thus it isfurthercon\ufb01rmedthat,asaresultofahighhardnessandlowelectrochemicalactivity,temperingistheoptimumheattreat-mentforreducingmateriallossesinthegrindingballsduetothe synergistic effect of erosion and corrosion.\nSince heat-treatment has an effect on the polarization\nresistance and the potentiodynamic characteristics, it mustalso affect the corrosion rates. Fig. 5shows the corrosion\nratesoftheheat-treatedsamplesasafunctionoftheamountof erodent. Both the annealed and the quenched specimenshave higher corrosion rates, and the corrosion rates increaserapidlywithincreasingamountoferodent.However,thetem-peredspecimenhasthelowestcorrosionrate,andthecorro-sion rate increases more slowly with increasing amount oferodentthaneithertheannealedorthequenchedspecimens.There is also a suggestion that the corrosion rate reaches aplateau at higher levels of erosion for the tempered speci-mens.\n3.2. The effect of heat treatment on strain energy\nThe quenching treatment itself introduces signi\ufb01cant mi-\ncrostrain into the steel which is not present in the annealedand tempered specimens ( Fig. 6). The tempering heat treat-\nment relieves the residual stress from the quenching treat-ment,whichcausesthehighcorrosionrate(shownin Fig.5).\nThe tempered samples have an adequate level of hardness(Table 1), such that erosion doesn\u2019t generate signi\ufb01cant mi-\ncrostrains in the tempered sample. However, the annealedsample,whichisrelativelyquitesoft,iseasilydeformedandhighermicrostrainsareintroducedthaninthetemperedsam-ples.\nTheincreasedstrainenergyduetothemicrostraincanbe\ncalculated from the following equation [22,23]:\nA=15E\n2(3\u22124\u00b5+8\u00b52)\u00d7/parenleftbigg/Delta1d\nd/parenrightbigg2\n(3)",

Conclusions\nAn investigation of the electrochemical behavior and mi-\ncrostrain and strain energy for 52100 steel specimens withdifferent heat treatments subjected to erosion\u2013corrosion ledto the following conclusions:\n1. Heat treatment causes changes in the open-circuit poten-\ntial,corrosionpotential,polarizationresistance,polariza-tion behavior, corrosion rate, and microstrain and storedstrain energies.\n2. Both the annealed and tempered specimens show a syn-\nergistic effect, which can be modeled using a mechano-electrochemical model, i.e. the theoretically calculatedand experimentally measured corrosion rates agree wellwith each other.\n3. The erosion\u2013corrosion behavior of quenched specimens,\nwhich contain high levels of microstrain from quench-ing,cannotbemodeledbythemechano-electrochemicalmodel.\n4.
