Ultra\ufb01ne-grained DP (UFG-DP) steel with an average ferrite grain size of about ~2.7 \u0016m\nand an average martensite island size of ~2.9 \u0016m was achieved. Tensile testing revealed superior\nmechanical properties (the ultimate tensile strength of 1267 MPa and uniform elongation of 8.2%) for\nthe new DP steel in comparison with the \ufb01brous DP steels. The superior mechanical properties are\nattributed to the in\ufb02uence of microstructure re\ufb01nement on the work-hardening and fracture behavior.\nKeywords: dual phase steel; cold-rolling; intercritical annealing; microstructure re\ufb01nement\n1. Introduction\nThe increasing demand for weight reduction with high safety performance in the automotive\nindustry has led to the continuous development of advanced high strength steels (AHSS), such as\ndual-phase (DP) and transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) steels [ 1\u20134]. Compared to other\nhigh-strength steel grades, DP steels involve a leaner alloy addition and can be produced using\nwell-adapted processes, while they show attractive balance between strength and formability [ 5\u20138].\nHowever, the new wave of fuel-economy regulations demands better combination between strength\nand ductility/toughness, so that the stringent design requirements can be met. One of the promising\napproaches achieving this desire is to produce DP steels with ultra\ufb01ne grain size. It has been well\nknown that grain re\ufb01nement of DP steels leads to huge strength enhancement without apparent\nsacri\ufb01ce of plasticity [ 9\u201320]. While, single-phase UFG materials usually show high strength but limited\nductility [ 19]. Previous studies [ 16] attributed the bene\ufb01ts of UFG-DP to optimizations of strain\nhardening rate, martensite plasticity and interface cohesion. A better understanding of the grain\nre\ufb01nement is worthy to be studied further to optimize mechanical properties of UFG-DP steels.\nHowever, the successful production of UFG-DP remains a challenge, which relies on starting\nwith the fine-scale microstructure and maintaining the structural scale during intercritical annealing.\nThe fine-scale initial microstructures can be achieved by severe plastic deformation (SPD).

[ 22] applied the equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) (accumulated strain of ~4) to\ngenerate a ferritic initial structure with the grain size of ~1 \u0016m and ~0.2 \u0016m, respectively. Tsuji [ 23]\nused the technique of accumulative roll bonding (ARB) to refine the initial ferrite grain size to 1.3 \u0016m\nwith the equivalent strain of 4.8. In addition, fast heating during intercritical annealing was found\nto be important to maintain the ultrafine grain size, which is allowed by the pinning of ferrite grain\nboundaries by the formation of austenite islands [ 6,7,24\u201326]. It is reported that the grain growth of\nferrite can only be significantly suppressed with the heating rate of 300 K/s [ 17]. Moreover, playing\nwith the interaction between ferrite recrystallization and austenite formation, the production of UFG-DP\nmicrostructures can be eased by increasing the Manganese content, which decreases the temperature of\naustenite formation and more efficient suppression of ferrite grain growth was resulted in [6].\nThe abovementioned techniques involving SPD, fast heating and increased Manganese alloying\nare, on the other hand, bringing barriers to the industrial manufacturing of UFG-DP . The objective of the\npresent work is to propose a new processing route for UFG-DP by designing the initial microstructure\nbefore intercritical annealing. The initial microstructure is a cold-rolled \ufb01brous ferrite\u2013martensite\ndual-phase steel. In this \ufb01ne-scale initial structure, the dispersion of martensite plates/islands offers\nhigh density of preferred nucleation sites for austenite formation, which enhances the ef\ufb01ciency of\npinning the migration of ferrite grain boundaries during intercritical annealing. This processing route\nproved effective in achieving UFG-DP microstructures. The mechanical properties of the UFG-DP were\nexamined by uniaxial tensile tests. The in\ufb02uence of microstructure re\ufb01nement on the work-hardening\nand fracture behavior are discussed.\n2. Materials and Methods\nThe chemical composition of the steel was shown in Table 1, which was determined using\nthe vacuum emission spectroscopy. The ingot was prepared in a 20 kg vacuum induction furnace\nwith a thickness of 50 mm. The slabs were cut to samples of 40 \u000230\u00028 mm for processing and\nmechanical testing.\nTable 1. Chemical composition (wt %) of the steel.\nElement Content\nC 0.19\nMn 1.01\nSi 1.46\nFe Balance\nFor the selection of processing temperatures, A1 and A3 temperatures were calculated using\nEquations (1) and (2) [27]:\nA1=723\u000010.7Mn \u000016.9Ni +29.1Si +16.9Cr +290As +6.38W (1)\nA3=910\u0000203C0.5\u000015.2Ni +44.7Si +31.5Mo +104V +13.1W (2)\nA1 and A3 temperatures were estimated as 755\u000eC and 887\u000eC, respectively. The processing route\nto develop UFG-DP microstructures is shown in Figure 1. Firstly, the samples were austenitized at\n920\u000eC for 60 min followed by water quench to obtain a martensitic microstructure. Then, an intercritical\nannealing (820\u000eC, 10 min) was performed to generate a \ufb01brous ferrite\u2013martensite microstructure.\nThe steel sheet were then cold rolled by 85% reduction in thickness in order to re\ufb01ne the structural\nscale. Finally, another intercritical annealing was performed on the cold-rolled sheets at 780\u000eC, 800\u000eC\nor 820\u000eC for 1.5 min, followed by water quenching. During the \ufb01nal intercritical annealing processing,\nin order to achieve relatively fast heating rate, the steel samples were submitted to the furnace at the\ntemperature of 780\u000eC, 800\u000eC or 820\u000eC. The samples are placed in direct contact with the heated iron\nblocks for an ef\ufb01cient heat transfer.",

The sectioned specimens were mounted, ground,\npolished and etched with 5% Nital solution. The microstructures were examined by optical microscope\n(OM) and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM, Quant 250 FEG). The SEM micrographs were\nquantitatively analyzed by image analysis following the procedure in [ 6] so that the volume fraction of\nmartensite and the average grain size of ferrite can be measured.\nThe steel sheets were cut into dog-bone shaped specimens for tensile testing, with the longititudinal\ndirection parallel to the rolling direction. The gage length, width and thickness of the tensile\nspecimens were 10 mm, 2.5 mm and 1.2 mm, respectively. Uniaxial tensile tests were performed\non an electromechanical universal testing machine (LFM-20kN) with a strain rate of 3\u000210\u00003s\u00001at\nroom temperature. Following the procedure in the literature [ 28], load-deformation curves of the\nsamples was tested and in order to get true strain some data processing was done. The displacement\nof the sample holder was measurement, and the strain was calculated by dividing the gauge length\nby such displacement, after calibrating the stiffness of the testing machine. The yield strength was\ndefined as the flow stress at 0.2% plastic strain. The uniform elongation was defined by the true strain\nat the moment of necking according to the Consid \u00e8re ecriterion [ 29]. Three samples were tested for\neach microstructural state.

Results and Discussion\n3.1. Microstructure Evolution During Processing\nThe as-received microstructure consists of a mixture of pearlite and ferrite (Figure 2a). The volume\nfraction of pearlite was measured as 40%, and the ferrite grain size is 30 \u0016m. After annealing at 920\u000eC\nfor 60 min, a martensitic microstructure was attained (Figure 2b). The small amount of ferrite is\ninevitable in this steel grade due to insuf\ufb01cient quenchability.",

Optical micrographs of ( a) as-received microstructure; and SEM micrographs of ( b) the\nmicrostructure after annealing at 920\u000eC for 60 min.\nThe martensitic initial structure was annealed at 820\u000eC for 10 min to produce the \ufb01brous DP steels.\nThe microstructure consists of 47 vol % ferrite and 53 vol % martensite (Figure 3a), and the \ufb01brous\nmorphology is considered as inheriting from the lath martensite during intercritical annealing [ 30].\nThe distribution of martensite islands is uniform within the microstructure, and banding structure,\nwhich is usually signi\ufb01cant in Mn-alloyed steels due to Mn segregation, cannot be observed. In order\nto re\ufb01ne the structural scale, cold-rolling to 85% thickness reduction was performed. As shown in\nFigure 3b, the dual-phase microstructure is well orientated along the rolling direction, with the mean\nspacing between martensite islands dramatically reduced. The martensite islands show the features\nof co-deformation with ferrite during cold-rolling, although the martensitic strength is much higher\nthan ferrite.\nFigure 3.

These microstructures show a uniform distribution of the\nequiaxed UFG ferrite grains (2~3 \u0016m) with the embedded UFG martensite islands (2~3 \u0016m), indicating\nthat the processing route works well in achieving ultra\ufb01ne-grained dual-phase microstructures.\nCompared to the \ufb01brous dual phase microstructure, UFG-DP (annealing at the same temperature\n820\u000eC) microstructure has a different martensite volume fraction, consisting of 38 vol % martensite\n(Figure 4d). This is mainly attributed to the soaking time. During the processing to obtain UFG-DP ,",
    "page_5": "Materials 2018 ,11, 1399 5 of 11\nthe short soaking time was used in order to avoid substantial grain growth during annealing. However,\nthe short soaking time of 1.5 min probably led to incomplete formation of the austenite. The \ufb01brous\nDP and the UFG-DP have different martensite volume fractions. Figure 4d also shows that increasing\nthe annealing temperature did not result in a larger ferrite grain size. During intercritically annealing\nthe microstructure as shown in Figure 3b, the austenite phase preferably forms from the existing\ncarbon-rich martensite islands. The amount of austenite phase is increased at a higher annealing\ntemperature, which is indicated by the evolution of martensite volume fraction after quenching. On the\nother hand, the driving force to recrystallization and grain growth of ferrite is large due to the heavy\ncold-rolling. The dispersion of easily formed austenite dispersions acts as ef\ufb01cient pinning points to\nthe migration of ferrite grain boundaries, which results in the fact that the \ufb01ne scale of the structure\nsurvived after the heat treatment. However, the recrystallization of ferrite is not fully suppressed,\nwhich explains the equiaxed ferrite grain shape. Moreover, as shown in the Figure 5, low-density\nof precipitations are observed in some ferrite grains. This could be explained by the procedure of\nthe heat treatment. The intercritical annealing was performed on the ferrite\u2013martensite mixture,\nwhere the Carbon is mainly in solute and concentrated in the martensite phase. The relatively fast\nheating rate also helped in restraining carbide precipitation and spheroidization. The contribution of\nsuch low-density precipitations to the \ufb02ow stress is considered to be the second-order effect, when\ncomparing with the effect of grain re\ufb01nement. The abovementioned microstructure evolution during\nthe processing steps was shown schematically in Figure 6.\nFigure 4.

Tensile Properties\nThe engineering stress-strain curves of as-received sample, the \ufb01brous DP steels and the UFG-DP\nsteels are compared in Figure 7a. All the samples show continuous yielding behavior, and the level\nof \ufb02ow stress is signi\ufb01cantly increased when the microstructure is re\ufb01ned. Figure 7b shows the true\nstress-strain curves and the corresponding evolution of strain hardening rate of the UFG-DP steels.\nAll the UFG-DP steels show a high strain hardening rate in the initial stages of the deformation, which\ndecreases gradually with strain. This salient strain hardening behavior enables the DP steels to possess\na low yield ratio, high tensile strength and relatively high uniform elongation. As compared to the\n\ufb01brous DP steels, the UFG-DP steels present both higher yield strength and tensile strength (Figure 7c).\nThis could be attributed to the reduced ferrite grain size in UFG-DP . The ferrite in \ufb01brous DP and\nin UFG-DP could behave differently. In a certain sense, the structural scale of ferrite in \ufb01brous DP\nis also in UFG regime in that the thickness of the ferrite lamella is about 2 \u0016m. However, the free\npath of dislocations along the length of the ferrite lamella could be rather large (tens of microns,\ncomparable with the prior austenite grain size), resulting in a large effective ferrite grain size. Indeed,\nthe yield strength of \ufb01brous DP steel is lower than the UFG-DP steels. In addition, although the size of\nmarteniste islands is also reduced in UFG-DP , this is presumably not contributing to the increase in\nmartensitic strength because the main metallurgical factor determining the strength of martensite is\ncarbon content [31].\nMoreover, according to Figure 7d, the uniform elongation (UE) of the UFG-DP1, 2 and 3 steel\n(samples after the \ufb01nal intercritical annealing at 780, 800 and 820\u000eC for 1.5 min.) is decreased with\nincreasing annealing temperature. When the annealing temperature is increased, the martensite\nvolume fraction ( Vm) is increased while the ferrite grain size (d f) is reduced (Figure 4d). Both of these\nfactors tend to decrease the uniform elongation of the DP steels [6,20].\nAn interesting point of UFG-DP is the excellent uniform elongation when comparing to other\nUFG single-phase ferrous alloys. It is reported that the ferritic steels with a grain size less than\n1\u0016m usually exhibit poor uniform elongation [ 19], but recent studies on grain re\ufb01nement in DP\nsteels show that the improvement of strength is not necessarily accompanied by a huge decrease of\nuniform elongation [6,32] . This could be attributed to the unique effect of simultaneously decreasing\nthe size of ferrite grains and martensite particles. During formation, the plastic strain incompatibility\nbetween ferrite and martensite induces a large number of geometrically necessary dislocations\n(GNDs) in the ferrite areas near the interfaces. The GND sources are increased with larger of the\nferrite/martensite interfacial regions [ 19]. Although the plastic incompatibility between the ferrite\nand martensite is weakened by grain re\ufb01nement, the huge dislocation multiplication in ferrite grains\nand the consequential additional back stress in the local region enables the UFG-DP microstructure to\nstrain harden, resulting in better ductility than UFG single-phase metals [33].",

Fractography\nObservations of fracture surfaces of the UFG-DP are shown in Figure 8. All fracture surfaces reveal\na mixture of cleavage facets and dimples. No large dimples were observed, which indicates that void\ngrowth is limited during the fracture processes. Instead, the dimples were all small and shallow. When\nthe intercritical temperature increases, the area fraction of cleavage facets increases and the sample\nexhibits a more brittle manner. It is reported that the DP steels with a high volume fraction of the\nmartensite could undergo brittle fracture at ambient temperature [ 6]. The brittle fracture of DP steels is\nusually induced by a micromorphology of interconnected martensite network [ 34,35]. Compared to\nisolated martensite islands, the martensite network in DP steels restricts the \ufb02ow of plasticity in the\nferrite by con\ufb01ning the slip systems [ 34] and induces a high degree of stress triaxiality. Presumably,\nthe damage nucleation occurs at the martensite phase that has lower toughness and bears higher\nstress level. Once the martensite fractures, the initiated crack in martensite imposes a concentrated\nstress \ufb01eld and also a high degree of stress triaxiality in the neighboring ferrite grain. In addition,\nsigni\ufb01cant elastic energy, which is stored due to the deformation of high-strength materials, can be\nreleased once the crack starts propagating, resulting in unstable crack growth. The abovementioned\nstress concentration, stress triaxialty and rapid release of elastic energy trigger the cleavage cracking in\nferrite neighboring the damaged martensite particles. It is the premature cracking in martensite that\ncontrols the fracture resistance and/or fracture strain in the UFG-DP steels. Hence, with an increasing",

Ultra\ufb01ne-grained ferrite\u2013martensite dual-phase steels were produced by intercritically annealing\nthe cold-rolled \ufb01brous DP microstructure. The generated dual-phase steels consisted of UFG\nferrite and uniformly distributed martensite islands. Ferrite grain size and martensite island size\nwere ~2.7 \u0016m and ~2.9 \u0016m, respectively.\n2. The UFG-DP steels exhibit an excellent strain hardening behavior, which is affected by the grain\nre\ufb01nement of both ferrite and martensite, enabling the simultaneous enhancement of UTS and\nUE to 1.2 GPa and 8%, respectively.\n3. The UFG-DP steels fractured in a partially brittle manner. A mixture of small dimples and\ncleavage facets was observed in the fracture surfaces. The fracture strain characterized by area\nreduction was decreased when the volume fraction of martensite was increased.\nAuthor Contributions: H.Z., Q.L. and Z.P . conceived and designed the experiments; Z.P . and B.G. performed the\nexperiments; Z.P ., X.C. and B.G. analyzed the data; H.Z., M.L. and Y.C. contributed analysis tools; Z.P ., Q.L. and\nH.Z. wrote the paper.\nFunding: This research was funded by the National Key R&D Program of China (grant number 2017YFA0204403),\nthe National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number 51601094 and 51601003), the Natural Science\nFoundation of Heilongjiang Province of China (grant number QC2017061), the Harbin Science and Technology\nBurean (grant number 2017RAQXJ066), and Open Project of State Key Laboratory of Advanced Special Steel in\nShanghai University (grant number SKLASS 2017-04) and the Scienti\ufb01c and Technological Committee of Shanghai\n(grant number: 15DZ2260100 and YDZX20173100001316).\nAcknowledgments: The authors wish to express their appreciations to the Nano and Heterogeneous Materials\nCenter, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology and the\nHerbert Gleiter Institute of Nanoscience, Nanjing University of Science and Technology.\nCon\ufb02icts of Interest: The authors declare no con\ufb02ict of interest.",
